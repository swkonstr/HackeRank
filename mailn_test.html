                                        <p>e are proud to bring you the 2014 edition
of the RT&amp;S Track Buyer’s Guide (TBG);
our annual digest detailing advancements among the equipment and practices
employed by the industry to keep North
America’s railroads in good repair and running strong.
Be assured that RT&amp;S remains committed to reporting
the information pertinent to railway engineering in 2014
through our print and digital editions, as well as our daily
and weekly e-newsletters.
To begin 2014, the TBG couples feature sections that
cover the industry’s core topics with keep-on-your-desk
reference material, such as the Categories, Directory and
Annual Index sections.
The Categories section, which this year starts on page
57, provides a go-to list of railroad engineering products
and services broken down into categories, then listed
alphabetically within the category. Following the Categories
section is the Directory section on page 63, which lists contact
information of suppliers, as well as a description of what the
company offers.
The TBG also includes the RT&amp;S Annual Index,
which lists all the stories, companies and topics covered
and published in the print edition of the magazine from
July 2012 through June 2013. Remember reading an
interesting article on a hybrid composite beam span, but
can’t remember when it appeared? Instead of flipping
through every back issue of RT&amp;S, simply look up “hybrid
composite beam span” and discover that the topic was
covered in our November 2012 and February 2013 issues.
As RT&amp;S enters its 109th year, I wish you happy reading.</p>

                                        <p>ffective rail maintenance strategies
are essential for maximizing
service life of rails under heavyaxle-load (HAL) operations. For this
purpose, Transportation Technology
Center, Inc. (TTCI), has been
investigating multiple practices in an
effort to optimize rail life extension
strategies in revenue service.
Rail performance testing has been
conducted in revenue service since the
fall of 2005 at the eastern and western
mega sites, located near Bluefield, W.
Va., and Ogallala, Neb., respectively.
Initially established to supplement rail
performance testing conducted at the
Facility for Accelerated Service Testing
in Pueblo, Colo., the scope of testing
in revenue service has since been
expanded to include evaluation of rail
maintenance strategies. This includes
evaluation of the long-term effects of
gauge-face (GF) lubrication, top-of-rail
(TOR) friction control and corrective
or preventative grinding practices. Test
results are providing valuable feedback
regarding the effect of such strategies
on the service life expectancy of rail in
HAL revenue service.
Thus far, the results obtained from
testing at the mega sites have been
very promising in regards to lower
rates of railhead wear, prevention of
rolling contact fatigue (RCF) and

                                        <p>At present, the premium rails installed in the test curves
within the western mega site have accumulated more than
1,800 mgt of traffic and have maintained excellent wear
performance throughout the course of the experiment. In
2008, the subject of this testing shifted from rail performance
to the evaluation of maintenance practices using two
different methods to control wear rates and RCF growth.
For all three test curves, no rail maintenance strategies,
except for the application of lubrication to the GF, were
implemented during the early stage of the experiment.
For the two-degree curves, RCF started to appear on
the low rails at approximately 300-350 mgt. As a result,
two corrective grindings were implemented before 700
mgt to remove the RCF. After 700 mgt, TOR friction
control was implemented for one of the two-degree
test curves while the other began receiving scheduled</p>

per the recommendations from earlier
modeling results.3 As a result of TOR
friction control, a corrective grind
was not required until 1,650 mgt of
traffic to remove RCF, which took
much longer to recur (i.e., 950 mgt,
see Figure 1).
Statistical testing was conducted
to compare the rate of wear before
and after implementation of TOR
friction control within the two-degree
test curve. Results have shown that
there was a reduction in the rate of
wear following the implementation
of TOR friction control for both the
high and low rail. Moreover, results
of statistical testing have shown that
railhead area loss through grinding
per mgt was also reduced for both
the high and low rails following the
implementation of TOR fr iction
control. Table 1 summarizes the rates
of wear and amount of metal removed
with each grind for all test curves.
Since the implementation of rail
maintenance strategies at 700 mgt,
the median railhead area loss for the
two-degree curve using TOR friction</p>
                                    
                                        <p>8	</p>
                                    
                                        <p>control is measured at 7.1 and three
percent for the high and low rails,
respectively. In contrast, the median
railhead area loss for the two-degree
cur ve implementing preventative
grinding is approximately 11.6 and
7.9 percent for the high and low rails,
respectively. Though preventative
grinding is effective in controlling
the spread of RCF, this method can
lead to more railhead area loss. At
the same time, preventative grinding,
generally consisting of a single pass,
saves on railhead area loss when
compared against corrective grinding
actions, which typically require
multiple passes to be made.
An issue observed after about 1,500
mgt of traffic was surface degradation
of some electric flash-butt welds.
However, TOR friction control did not
appear to be effective in preventing the
cracking and surface damage associated
with those flash welds.
The one-degree test cur ve did
not incor porate any of the rail
maintenance strategies seen at the
two-degree test curves at the western
mega site. As such, this test curve</p>
                                    
                                        <p>developed moderate yet isolated
areas of RCF after approximately
960 mgt and multiple corrective
grinds were undertaken subsequently
to prevent fur ther progression of
these spots. Though no inter nal
fatigue defects have been identified,
severe sporadic surf ace defects
consistent with spalling developed
at multiple locations on the high rail,
which led to the eventual removal of
the test rail at 1,782 mgt.</p>
                                    
                                        <p>Results: Eastern mega site</p>
                                    
                                        <p>With approximately 415 mgt
accumulated to date, the premium
test rails within the eastern mega
site continue to show excellent wear
performance and resistance to internal
fatigue. GF lubrication and TOR
friction control have been used at
each of the four test curves since the
initiation of the test in 2005. As well,
corrective grinding was implemented
on three separate occasions to remove
RCF and plastic flow during the
course of testing.
The surf ace condition of the
rails within the test curves was in
excellent shape until approximately
250 mgt when the low rails within
the two 10-degree test curves began
to show signs of RCF. An additional
100 mgt was accumulated before the
6.8-degree test curves began to show
similar signs of RCF growth on the
low rail. A corrective grind to address
RCF was performed at 275 mgt and
365 mgt for the 10- and 6.8-degree
test curves, respectively.
Figure 2 shows the average rail
wear test results attributed to both
traffic and grinding on the high and
low rails for the 10.5-degree test
curve. For the 10.5-degree test curve
under normal traffic, the median area
railhead loss per 100 mgt is 0.09 in2
and 0.11 in 2 for the high and low
rails, respectively. The 6.8-degree test
curves, on the other hand, typically
wear at a median rate of approximately 0.04 in2 per 100 mgt for both rails.
Refer to Table 1 for a complete summary of the railhead area loss associated with both traffic and grinding.
Around 300 mgt, the low rail
within the two 10-degree test curves
began to show field-side plastic flow.
By 415 mgt, the plastic flow formed a
distinct 0.2-inch lip on the field side
of the railhead at multiple locations
throughout the curve.

                                        <p>Chemetron Railway Products, a division
of Progress Rail Services, acquired the
mobile welding units from RibbonWeld
LLC in 2012. The company says
this addition allows for an expanded
product offering and allows a broader
mix of welding equipment to match
customer requirements.
“Our 110-ton welders are ideal
for joint elimination and portable
welding and the 180-ton integrated
pullers or 72-ton with puller are
ideal for rail installation work,” said
Mark McLean, manager sales. “We
recently commissioned our first track
welder. This Cat track-hoe based unit
has a self-contained welding system,
allowing us to access remote locations</p>
                                    
                                        <p>for rail and special trackwork welding.
The unit has high-speed, hi-rail
capability for use in a gang consist.”
McLean points out that Chemetron
has also added another train to its
welded rail train fleet, complementing
the existing fleet and strengthening the
company’s capability to provide rail,
rail welding and equipment to deliver
CWR to customers.
“As par t of our continuous
improvement process, Chemetron is
refining the uniformity of the heataffected-zone (HAZ), while we
continue focusing on reducing the size
of the HAZ. These advances will be
implemented in both our fixed plant
and mobile welding systems. The
improved uniformity and reduction in
size of the HAZ will extend the life of

systems without removing the power rail.
Charles Ewing, managing director, says the machine will
offer complete welding of large turnouts in one shift and its
compact size will allow more work to be performed during
tight work windows experienced on transit systems.
Responding to operational requests, Ewing says the
company is refining the design of its high pull, selfshearing (distressing/joint elimination) welding head.
Ewing notes that most customers have the same
concerns as they pertain to rail welding: minimum rail
usage, narrow heat-affected zone, uniform hardness, lack
of grey spots/inclusions and asking to weld to high-speed
rail standards.
“Working with our partners in the Ukraine (Paton
Welding Institute), processes have been developed to
meet the foregoing requests,” said Ewing. “Construction
of the machines ensures that the highest standards of
alignment are achieved. The processes developed virtually
eliminate the grey spots.”
Ewing continued, “Ongoing research is being done in
conjunction with our partners (Paton Welding Institute)
in Kiev involving rail steel producers. Process design is
an ongoing task and follows the new steel technology that
is introduced. It is our belief that our welding process
is by far the most advanced in the field. More physical
field testing is required to supplement the analysis
carried out from the weld monitoring systems currently</p>

                                        <p>Holland L.P. continues the development of its Flash
Butt Head Defect Repair Weld, which it says enables its
customers to remove and replace a defect in the head of the
rail with a rail plug matching the hardness of the rail steel
and without disturbing the rail neutral temperature.
“We are continuing to expand our capabilities for
flash-butt welding joints in turnouts. Since the turnouts
are the more expensive portions of the track structure,
it only makes sense to have the highest quality flashbutt welds. Utilizing new equipment configurations will
enhance our abilities and improve productivity in this
welding application,” said Kevin Flaherty, vice president,
maintenance-of-way sales.
Additionally, this year is the beginning of the Holland

improvements include new and upgraded welding control
systems, slip detectors and weld process refinements, which
all contribute to higher quality finished weld products.
“Our customers continue to request improvements in
flash-butt welds that produce lower installed cost, more
durable welds (last the life of the rail without surface
defects), ability to flash-butt weld rail to frogs and more.
Our improvement drive is producing many of these
outcomes,” said Flaherty. “Work to reduce the HAZ, harder
welds matching the parent rail steel, increased reliability
and improving weld quality are areas that Holland
continually works to improve.”
Another aspect of continued product improvement is
research and development, which Holland believes holds the
key to its ongoing success in the rail welding business.
“Holland’s R&amp;D efforts are derived from a myriad
of sources. First and most important, we listen to our
customers to learn their needs. We work with the rail
manufacturers to develop weld programs of all rail types,
hold brain-storming sessions both within Holland and
outside our organization,” said Flaherty. “We conduct
market studies to gather information on rail welding needs
from throughout the rail industry, both in North America
and internationally.”
Flaherty also notes that Holland encourages and
engages in technology partnerships to expand the source of
information for rail welding development from beyond the</p>

                                        <p>In 2012, Lincoln Electric began a program partnering
with railroad customers to locate manganese welding
crews with a basic under standing of welding on
manganese frogs and crossing diamonds in regions where
training schools were not available.
The company administered two-day classes, one-day
classroom, the next day hands-on welding, at more than a
dozen locations. These classes trained welders on how to
set up the Lincoln equipment at the proper settings, check
for trouble spots in the system and tips on how to service
every part of the equipment chain. According to Lincoln
Electric, application of consumables at the required
voltage and the proper technique in welding brought the
welders to a higher level of understanding.
The next year, Lincoln Electric went to the same
locations to elevate the skill to the next level.
“The first time at the locations, we covered basic
things,” said Brian Meade, Lincoln Electric’s manager of</p>

                                        <p>railroad technical services, global accounts. “We worked
hard communicating with our engineers at our main plant
in Cleveland, Ohio, and gathered the welders to come up
with new techniques and a higher understanding to teach
the second time around.”
Meade continued, “We have improved the welding
machine, feeding systems, consumables, packaging and have
added new products like the Magnum Pro welding gun.
These improvements have made it easier for the welders,
giving them more of an edge to increase their skill level.”
According to Meade, railroad welding crews in the field

                                        <p>Head Alloyed Welding (HAW) process, which allows
welding of high-strength rails with more compatible weld
running surface hardness and a ductile base. According
to the company, the welding procedures and tools used to
execute the HAW are identical to that of a standard weld,
except that a patented diverting plug that contains microalloys is used, instead of a conventional diverting plug.
“This feature makes it very easy for the customer to
employ the HAW process, with minimal training and no
outlay of additional costs for any special tooling. The HAW
process is simple and can be performed by any trained
welding crew with the current tools they have on their
welding vehicles,” said Randolph.
In Febr uar y 2011, after successful laborator y
metallurgical and physical testing evaluations, 10 Head
Alloyed Thermit® Welds were installed at TTCI’s Facility
for Accelerated Service Testing Heavy Tonnage Loop.
Seven of these Head Alloyed Welds were used to join
high-strength rails with an initial hardness of around
390 BHN. Two of the Head Alloyed Welds were made
in intermediate strength rails with a hardness of 340
BHN and one Head Alloyed Weld was made to join an
intermediate strength rail (340 BHN) to a high strength
rail (390 BHN).
“Although Orgo-Thermit Inc. does not recommend
using the Head Alloyed Welds in mixed strength or
standard strength rail welding, this test was performed to
investigate how unintended application of the micro-alloyed</p>

Orgo-Thermit Inc. recommends that when welding a highstrength rail to a lower strength rail, the welding portion for
the lower-strength rail is used,” said Randolph.
TTCI conducted hardness measurements, visual
inspections and longitudinal profiles of the entire weld
running surfaces throughout the duration of the test. The
Head Alloyed Welds have accumulated more than 324 mgt
of heavy-axle-load traffic, with no service failures. In the
intermediate strength rail (340 BHN); the Head Alloyed
weld was significantly harder than the adjacent rail. The
Head Alloyed Weld experienced a lower wear rate than
that of the rail. The weld centerline of Head Alloyed Welds,
employed to join the high-strength rails (390 BHN), have
shown approximately 50 percent reduction in wear/batter</p>
                                    
                                        <p>compared to standard welds, despite any of the Head
Alloyed Welds not having received maintenance grinding
of any kind since the commencement of the test.
“We believe that the success of our research and
development efforts will ensure that our unique Thermit®
welding products will have a future in the heavy-axle-load
railroad industry, for many years to come,” said Randolph.</p>

                                        <p>“Our patented QP Hybrid molds have been a customer
favorite this year and we are working hard on meeting the
increasing demand for this product,” said Oliver Dolder,
executive vice president and chief operating officer. “The
QP Hybrid molds use a compressible lining in order to get
a perfect fit on the rail. This allows the welders to make a
great quality weld by drastically reducing the chances of any
flashing to occur during the welding process which in turn
significantly increases the life of the weld.”
Dolder says the company’s HWR weld has found success
among customers in the repair of transverse defects, corner
gauge defects and minor shelling. He calls the HWR a great
“preventative maintenance weld,” which gives the customer
an opportunity to repair a small defect before it grows and
leads to a break in the rail.
Railtech Boutet notes that its Startwel® Ignition System
allows the welder to easily ignite the weld charge to initiate
the pour process for the Railtech Aluminothermic Weld
System, replacing the traditional “sparkler” igniter design.
“This new electric ignition system is safer than today’s
traditional igniters,” said Dolder. “In addition, Startwel® is
classified as non-hazardous for transport, therefore there
are no shipping restrictions (can be shipped overnight if
there was an emergency) and provides more accurate and
consistent tap time.”
The company’s trio of new products wouldn’t be possible
without the research and development team, which is done
by Railtech Boutet’s parent company, Railtech International.

                                        <p>“The year has been relatively quiet on the demand side of
the tie industry,” noted Jim Gauntt, executive director of
the RTA. “Our growth forecast from earlier in the year was
trimmed to 22.9 million ties for 2013 in the latest update.
With coal shipments lower and an economy that is just
treading water with only marginal growth, that is still an
incredibly strong showing by railroad purchasers.”
Gauntt says the biggest unforeseen challenge to the market right now has been log supply. Incredibly wet weather
throughout most of the year, along with a logging community that has been constrained in capacity by attrition during the previous recession, has led to tie supply issues.
“Logs are not the only concern for tie suppliers,” he said.
“The impacts of a better housing market and the demand
for low-grade wood for crane mats and board road for the
domestic oil industry has further tightened supply. Overall,
the supply of ties has been cut by 20 percent year-to-date
through August from 2012.
“Depending on your perspective, the oil shale infrastructure build out for materials supply and oil shipments
have actually bolstered demand for ties. This has mitigated
the loss of demand due to the reduction in coal shipments.
Shortline industry and other users have also remained relatively stable,” he says.
“For demand to be only 200,000-300,000 ties less than
2012, there are still a lot of good things going for railroads,”
Gauntt explained. “Whatever generates freight shipment by
rail translates into stout maintenance programs.”
If the economy grows as expected in recent Standard and
Poor’s forecasts for 2014, Gauntt says the industry should
see a potential tie demand rebound to 23.5 million ties.
Unfortunately, the supply imbalances won’t go away anytime soon, he notes.

                                        <p>“The question will be, can demand be met? We have
already seen the impacts of insufficient supply be realized
in the marketplace with higher prices for ties and that may
impact 2014 budgets for large and small roads alike. Even if
fundamental demand is more than 23 million, actual realized purchases could fall short of that. The expectation, as
of now, is that imbalances could remain in the supply side
into 2015,” Gauntt said.</p>

conjunction with the Class 1 railroads, on alternative wood
preservative systems. Alternative Wood Preservative Program
(RTA-AWPP) is being conducted by Mississippi State University in two separate sites using full-size tie replicates. The
two sites differ in that one site is infested with native subterranean termites indigenous to the U.S. and the second site is
infested with Formosan subterranean termites. Several preservative oil-borne, water-borne and dual-treatment systems
are being evaluated in a side-by-side comparative test.
“Phase 1 of the 20-year study has been underway for five
years and Phase 2 was installed in 2012,” Gauntt noted.
“The second phase includes testing on a variety of ACZA
products and the Koppers’ and Stella-Jones’ dual-treatment systems that differ from the two-step process that was
originally introduced in 2004. All of these systems, and all
of those included in Phase 1, are being evaluated against
untreated and creosote-only controls. The idea is to measure
any differential performance observed in seven by nine ties.</p>

“The dual-treated crosstie is a great improvement over the
traditional creosote treated tie,” said Ashley Baker, chief legal
counsel. “We have sold a lot of copper naphthenate crossties
to our customers and we understand they were strategically
placed in areas for review and monitoring.”
The increased rainfall this summer has tightened the green
tie inventory, Boatright says. Loggers could simply not get the
product out of the woods. Alabama, where its manufacturing
plant is located, had a 50 percent increase in rainfall.
The company says it is constantly trying to be more
efficient. Boatright has invested in new plating and borate
applications in its tie mill operations.
For Koppers, Inc., demand for treated railroad products
has remained strong. John Giallonardo, senior sales manager, says Class 1 demand has remained relatively consistent across the board, with the shortline/contractor/transit
markets showing some variability by region.
“There have been some significant raw material challenges this year for the industry, due primarily to the
disparity between grade lumber pricing and crosstie pricing, stated Giallonardo. “This has been sparked by the
continued recovery of the U.S. housing industry and the
related flooring market, as well as the increase in demand
for crane mats and board road material required for the
shale gas industry. RTA data confirms that crosstie purchases are down. However, recent financial support from
the Class 1 railroads should help stem the tide and bring
more stability back to the marketplace.”</p>

                                        <p>Koppers says it continues to see a positive outlook for tie
demand both short-term and long-term. The Class 1s continue to be consistent with their maintenance and tie buying
programs. The possible extension of the 45G tax credits for
2014 would be a tremendous boost for the shortline industry
and would allow those companies to maximize investments in
their infrastructure, Giallonardo explains.
The current state of the raw material market is without
question the primary issue that is most impacting our industry, Giallonardo says.
“Pricing competition from several different end-use
markets has made it a challenge to procure enough ties to
meet the needs of the entire industry,” he noted. “Hopefully, recently instituted price corrections will help reverse
this trend.”
“Class 1s continue to spend capital on infrastructure
improvements, as well as funding projects related to the
shale gas and Bakken oil boom,” explained George Caric,
vice president of marketing at Stella-Jones, Inc. “The
growth in shipments of frac sand, pipe and oil by rail has
created demand for new track construction from our commercial segment, as well. Last year, we reported that we
started construction of a new treating plant in Cordele, Ga.,
and we are excited to say we have started treating and will
be up to full production by November 1.”
During the past year, Caric notes that the use of dualtreated ties is now being accepted by all of the Class 1s.
The company has also noticed a pick-up in demand for
bridge timbers and has made significant capital improve-</p>

this demand that it estimates will be
strong in the coming years.
While Stella-Jones is confident it
will source all its customers’ requirements, a major challenge currently
impacting the crosstie market is a
potential shortage of green tie production, as well as a resurgent demand
for hardwood lumber along with the
continued demand for board road and
mat timber due to the aforementioned
oil and gas industry boom.</p>

                                        <p>KSA’s pre-stressed concrete crossties
are manufactured at its facility located
in Sciotoville, Ohio, and are designed
for heavy-haul mainlines, mass transit
and industrial applications.
According to the company, KSA’s
ties meet or exceed all current AREMA specifications and have a 22year proven track record of reliability
along with being both PCI and AAR
M-1003 quality certified.
“Though sales are down, [the year]
will be considered a very good year,”
explained Scott Craig, general manag-</p>

                                        <p>er. “The bulk of the business this year
has mainly come from heavy-haul and
industrial applications. Two of the industrial projects have involved a newlydesigned gantry tie used in association
with a new crane for coal handling facilities located in Southern Louisiana.”
Craig notes that the outlook for
2014 is looking like a solid year and
says it looks to be more diverse with
a very even mix of heavy-haul, transit
and industrial projects.
According to Jim McCaslin, general manager concrete products at
L.B. Foster Company, the past year
has presented a number of opportunities for the company to expand its
concrete tie business.
“Recently, we reorganized our
North American sales team to create a
more customer-centric sales organization,” said McCaslin. “Each customer,
whether they are a Class 1 railroad,
transit agency, shortline/regional railroad or contractor, will have one primary outside point of contact and one
primary inside point of contact. We
want to improve the ease of doing business, enhance our external and internal</p>
                                    
                                        <p>communications and provide new and
innovative products and services for
our customers.”
McCaslin continued, “During the
past year, the company has enjoyed
steady demand for concrete ties among
our Class 1 and industrial customers,
but demand from transit agencies is
trending up. We have experienced a
nice increase in demand from North
American transits throughout the past
year. And despite issues with federal,
state and local funding for these types
of projects, we remain very optimistic
that demand from that segment will
remain solid.”
The past year in the Midwest has
proven to be successful for L.B. Foster.
The company has supplied concrete
ties to North and South Dakota and
other Midwest states’ rapidly growing
oil and natural gas development projects. The company’s 399 series gantry
tie is seeing increased growth in port
applications, McCaslin explains.
“For example, working with RailWorks, L.B. Foster is providing ties for
the Port of Los Angeles TraPac Terminal. And in transit applications, the</p>

                                        <p>company has been awarded contracts to supply ties to Bay
Area Rapid Transit (BART) as part of the BART extension
to Antioch, Calif., as well as ties to Los Angeles County
Metropolitan Transportation Authority for the Expo II project,” he said.
On the Research &amp; Development side, L.B. Foster has
developed different types of resilient, dual block concrete
ties. Through the collaboration of the company’s transit
products and concrete tie technical teams, the Low Vibration Track Tie in two different length designs were supplied
to BART for the Warm Springs extension.
“The longer length design can accommodate an extension bracket for mounting a power rail insulator post,”
McCaslin noted. “This also continues to build upon the
successful relationship that L.B. Foster has with Kiewit
Parsons on West Coast transit projects. The company
also continues to work with government and university
research teams. The goal is to successfully translate new
product and research ideas into novel solutions for the
company’s key end use customers.”
Business is strong for Rocla Concrete Tie Inc. (RCTI),
the company notes and says the concrete tie industry continues to have a backlog of work due to a good mix between
heavy-haul customers and transit-oriented work.
“The Class 1 railroads are beginning to request pre-recession level volumes for their capital programs,” explained
Brett Urquhart, sales manager.
He says he sees projects in the West Coast ports as strong
areas of investment. Port of Los Angeles, Port of Long</p>

                                        <p>Beach, Port of Oakland and Manzanillo, Mexico, continue
to invest to take advantage of the growing economies in the
Asian markets, he explains.
“We expect the ports’ intermodal market to continue to
rise along with growth for the Class 1 railroads intermodal
traffic,” Urquhart said.
Additionally, RCTI is supplying projects for BART, Sacramento Regional Transit and the Regional Transportation
District in Denver.
Rocla, along with fastener suppliers and its key customers have developed a new “Yard Tie” for less demanding
heavy- haul applications and industrial track.
“The combination of a more cost effective tie and fastening system offers concrete ties at a more competitive price
than wood,” noted Urquhart. “The price advantage, along
with the fact that up to 25 percent fewer ties are needed
per mile, ensure that concrete continues to be the lowest
installed cost for all tie types, while offering the substantial
life-cycle benefits of concrete ties.”
Rocla finished commissioning its new facility in Pueblo,
Colo., and is scheduled to complete an expansion project to
add even more capacity to this facility. This will bring its overall capacity in Pueblo to almost one million ties per year.
“This investment is necessary to keep us with the ongoing demand of the Class 1 railroads and a strong mix of
industrial and transit projects,” he explained.</p>

                                        <p>Axion International Inc. says its business continues to grow
this year. It’s recycled composite material has been used in
tunnels, crossings and switch sets.
“We are actually seeing both the transits and freight lines
give greater recognition to the overall cost of maintenance and
repairs and the role that composites can play in reducing those
and replacement costs,” said James Kerstein, founder and chief
technology officer. “The longevity offered by Ecotrax® ties encourages the industry to review overall life-cycle costs. The railroads also seem to be stressing environmental impact considerations, with composites yielding positive results with regard to
sustainability and greatly reduced disposal costs.”
Axion says that it and its rail industry partners are dedicated to seeing the standards for composite ties raised to
more accurately reflect the needs of the industry and to
eliminate borderline manufacturers who have not utilized
the proper AREMA and ASTM test standards or had those
tests performed at independent outside laboratories.
“Axion is dedicated to answering the ever growing needs
of the rail industry by addressing long-term means of reducing price, locking in consistent and reliable supplies of material and improved manufacturing processes and continuing
to support strict quality control efforts,” Kertsein explained.
IntegriCo Composites says business has doubled over
the previous year and is slated for similar increases in 2014
and beyond. Additionally, the company named a new CEO,
Scott Mack, who will lead the company in the future. IntegriCo says its growth in 2013 can be attributed to corporate
sustainability initiatives, in-track performance of its composite products and expanded marketing coverage.
“IntegriTIES out-perform all other tie materials in highdecay areas and caustic environments and are ideal for areas with limited access such as bridges, tunnels and transit
systems,” explained Matt McCooe, vice president sales and

shortlines, industries, ports, transits and government facilities. Our customers like the idea of a long-term cost solution
without related disposal costs. IntegriTIES can be recycled
into new ties at the end of their useful life cycle with IntegriCo’s state-of-the-art processing equipment.”
McCooe believes AREMA Committee 30 – Ties, will
be considering a change in the future to raise the minimum performance standards for composite ties to reflect
higher minimums based on documented in-track composite tie performance.
“As part of our commitment to quality, IntegriCo is also
pursuing additional test methods to better predict future failure modes of composite ties and will keep the industry updated regarding our progress in that regard,” he said.
One of the major challenges facing all recycled plastic crosstie manufacturers has been a history of starts and stops due
to initial quality issues, McCooe explains and says that since
2009, IntegriCo has answered the challenge via changes to its
processes and formulation.
“Since the changeover in 2009, more than 150,000 IntegriTIES have been installed in track, some of which have
accumulated more than 50 mgt annually in wet, high-rot
locations. Railroaders realize our ties can be installed easily
with existing equipment and, most importantly, will last up
to 50 years in track.”</p>
                                    
                                        <p>Preservation, life extension</p>
                                    
                                        <p>Encore Rail Systems, Inc., supplies the products, as well as
the application equipment, for extending the life of wood and
concrete crossties. One of the company’s newest products is its
SpeedSet® UV epoxy system for the prevention of concrete tie
seat abrasion. Encore is currently providing the epoxy and application equipment to four tie plants in the U.S. and Mexico.
The epoxy is applied on the seat of the concrete ties after they
are unmolded. Encores’ epoxy products were first applied in the
field more than 12 years ago and the company says the railroads</p>
                                    
                                        <p>are reporting no sign of epoxy degradation or seat abrasion.
Encore recently installed its SpeedSet UV epoxy system at
the Itisa Concrete Tie Plant in Puebla, Mexico. Both the Ferrocarrill and Ferrosur railroads are having their ties coated at
the plant. Encore is now applying SpeedSet to more than one
million ties a year, the company says and notes that it has the
ability to repair concrete ties out of track.
Encore also developed a remedial wood tie repair product
that can be applied after the ties are adzed in the rail gang
consist. This product has a borate solution that penetrates
the wood and protects the area from tie rot.
“It provides longer life to wood ties, especially in the
southern states, where ties would normally be changed out
more frequently,” noted Doug Delmonico, president.
“Encore now has multiuse equipment so that one of our
ride on tie pluggers, for example, can do concrete ties and
wood ties without having to change tanks or dispensing equipment; a versatility found nowhere else in the industry. Another
new development in the works is an application system utilizing remote controls with no need for an operator,” he said.
Encore has seen an increased use of tie plugging equipment expand throughout the industry and has increased its
fleet of equipment to more than 110 units. Another trend
Encore is seeing is the process of coating concrete ties at the
plant with more and more railroads requesting that ties be
coated with SpeedSet as a part of the manufacturing process.
“Customers are asking us to provide more information
about their tie plugging equipment and process,” Delmonico
explained. “In response, we have installed GPS units on all of
our machines. These units offer the railroads a reporting system.
They can see where the machines are located, when they are
traveling or working, the number of feet plugged and even how
many times the trigger on the dispensing valve was pulled on
a daily basis. We also have tied the material in the tanks to the
GPS system so that the supervisors on the gangs can see how
much material is in the tanks and how much was used during
the day with accuracy of about plus or minus one percent.”

                                        <p>Lonza Wood Protection/Arch Wood
Protection, Inc., licenses the production of Chemonite® ACZA-treated
crossties. Since October 2012, two additional treaters of Chemonite ACZAtreated wood products have begun production, one in Oregon and the other
in Ontario, Canada. While demand has
remained about the same, the company says, adding these new treating
facilities makes ACZA products more
readily available.
“ACZA-treated crossties are economical,” noted Tim Carey, business
manager Chemonite Products. “Additionally, ACZA can be treated with
borates in an efficient single step.”
While the company has been offering ACZA-borate ties for several years,
Lonza now offers a 25-year limited
warranty against termites and decay
for Douglas-fir and hardwoods treated
with ACZA-borate.
“ACZA has been providing reliable service for decades in demanding applications,” noted Carey. “The
USDA Forest Products Laboratory
tested ACZA-treated stakes in Saucier, Miss., in ground contact at a 0.25
pcf retention (0.40 pcf is the standard
treatment for crossties) and after 30
years, there are still no failures. In
this test, neither creosote nor copper
naphthenate showed better performance than Chemonite ACZA.”
He notes that Chemonite is an excellent Type 3 termiticide, killing the
colony rather than just individual termites through direct contact and says
that it’s proven against Formosan termites and carpenter ants and has fireresistance properties.
“We have installations in south
Florida and Canada to evaluate climate exposure,” said Carey. “After two
years, 100 percent of the ties installed
in the extreme south Florida climate
are performing well; none have failed.”
“Plus,” added Carey, “a recent lifecycle analysis conducted by an independent consulting firm, confirmed
that ACZA-treated crossties have lower
environmental impact than concrete or
plastic/composites crossties for each of
the six categories assessed.”
“The growth of our QNAP® copper
naphthenate and Cellutreat® disodium
octaborate tetrahydrate (DOT) borate wood preservative have exceeded
our expectations,” explained Kevin L.
Kirkland, president and CEO of Nisus
Corporation. “The Class 1 railroads
have been very positive with regard to
22	</p>
                                    
                                        <p>both products and we are now seeing
purchases from shortlines and transit.
We believe that dual treatments using
borates will become a standard specification for all railroads with tracks
in American Wood Protection Association’s high and severe decay hazard
zones 4 and 5.”
The railroads seem to be very excited about both the green environmental
profile and the safer handling characteristics of the borate and QNAP ties,
notes Kirkland. He says, the products
are Environmental Protection Agency
registered, use non-restricted pesticides with no listed carcinogens, have
a low toxicity and produce minimal
odor. Kirkland notes that QNAP-treated ties will not burn the skin of workers
who handle them and there is minimal
bleeding or drippage when used on
bridge timbers.
“We are seeing a trend to try to extend the life of existing and new bridge
timbers by adding borates,” said Kirkland. “Wood ties have the lowest carbon
footprint of any form of ties available
and remain the most sustainable. They
actually sequester carbon and can be
used for fuel at the end of their life. The
primary challenges with wooden railroad ties are incipient decay, spike kill
and heartwood treatment. A tie that is
dual-treated by dip diffusion in DOT
borate prior to air seasoning, then pressure treated with copper naphthenate
solves all these problems.”
“Our customers want to understand the differences in physical properties of the different tie life-extension
products,” explained Mike Raab, owner and vice president of operations of
R-Solutions. “As crosstie repair becomes more standardized within the
maintenance-of-way programs of our
customers, there is an effort on their
part to understand the differences in
pricing and physical properties of the
particular tie life-extending materials
being presented to the industry.”
R-Solutions receives most of its business for tie life-extension products from
Class 1s and contractors for shortlines.
A recent project that R-Solutions
worked on in conjunction with Racine
Railroads Products was the development of a new piece of application machinery. The delivery system developed
for its customers was in direct response
to industry needs.
“As tie life-extension products become more prevalent, the need for
safer and more efficient equipment was</p>
                                    
                                        <p>needed,” Raab said. “So, in response to
industry need, a new type of ride on tie
plugging application technology was developed. The equipment has a state-ofthe-art metering system for an accurate
mix ratio 100 percent of the time. Also,
the unit has an enclosed cab capable of
dispensing material from the comfort of
an enclosure with a joy stick.”
Willamette Valley Company (WVCO)
is a manufacturer of polyurethane
polymers and compounds that has serviced the railroad industry since 1999.
WVCO has two flagship technologies
for the remediation of wood and concrete crossties. SpikeFast®, a non-foam
urethane compound is used for spike
hole filling or tie plugging and CTR100, which is used on concrete ties
to restore the rail seat and hasten the
onslaught of rail seat abrasion. WVCO
says Both technologies and the application equipment are consistently
under continuous improvement. Now,
WVCO is bringing a new technology
into the railroad industry, FastPatch,
which is a polyurethane repair technology for concrete spalling.
“FastPatch has tremendous integral flexibility, superior rebound and
compression strength, tenacious adhesion to concrete surfaces and can
be applied with WVCO’s application
equipment,” noted John Murray, vice
president. “FastPatch has been used to
repair failed concrete at scales, hump
yards, locomotive repair shops and insitu concrete tie repair.”
FastPatch can be used to make a
non-structural repair on concrete ties
where damage has caused exposed rebar. These patch repairs can be done insitu, cures in 15 minutes and prevents
further corrosion, Murray explains.
Most of WVCO’s business is derived from the Class 1s and shortlines,
however the company is now selling
FastPatch high performance rail grouts
for imbedded rail installations to light
rail and transits.
“WVCO is working with the industry to provide polymer solutions that
can remediate existing infrastructure
improvements in a fast, durable and
safe manner, compared to the inferior
repair products currently be utilized,”
Murray said. “FastPatch repair products are fast curing, absorb and deflect
energy with thier high integral flex
physical properties. When these characteristics occur, the repairs have a
longer life cycle than the traditional repair products.”

                                        <p>Collaboration has been a valuable tool
to Amsted RPS, allowing the company
to enhance and expand its product offering. The company recently announced
a joint venture with Switzerland-based
Schwihag AG, which specializes in the
development and manufacturing of
advanced switch and rail fastening technologies. Amsted RPS says this combined effort will result in the manufacture of “skl”-style rail fastening systems
for the worldwide heavy-haul market.

                                        <p>The first product launch from this
new “skl” system is the ME63. The
system includes the ME1 clip, rail pad,
abrasion plate, field guide plate, gauge
guide plate, screw spike and dowel.
“An advanced manufacturing technology is used, resulting in less stress
present in the clip and a higher fatigue
limit, resulting in longer life and
reduced maintenance costs,” said Jose
Mediavilla, director of engineering.
Last year, Amsted RPS partnered
with edilon)(sedra, a Netherlandsbased company known for its noise
and vibration reducing products.
The partnership allows Amsted RPS
to provide a line of complementary
products to its resilient bonded direct
fixation fasteners, such as embedded
block, embedded rail systems and
resilient Trackelast pads.
The company continues to manufacture bonded fastening systems, such</p>
                                    
                                        <p>as the System Wide series, which is
engineered for standard direct fixation applications and specialty fasteners, such as the Egg and Loadmaster,
which were designed for high attenuation and heavy-axel-load environments. Additionally, Amsted RPS says
it continues to evolve its MACRO
Armor line, developed to repair abraded and protect new concrete ties with
the ultra abrasion resistant and highlydurable MACRO material. An added
benefit of the material is that it can be
molded into shapes that act as a form,
allowing epoxy to be pumped through
the MACRO Armor repair plate to fill
the void created by rail seat abrasion.
The company’s Atchison, Kan.,
manufacturing facility will be expanded to accommodate capacity for new
products, as well as meet “Buy America” compliance requirements.

anchors, added a new flat stock clip line to make our 2000
and 6030LR Safelok style clips, built a state-of-the-art test
laboratory and we are now building a round bar clip line for
ME1 production to support our customer’s need for high
quality, U.S.-based manufacturing,” said Wes Hodges, vice
president and general manager.
Amsted RPS says listening to its customers is what steers
product development initiatives and as those customer
needs evolve, so do the products offered.
Amsted RPS points to its 6030LR rail clip as one example
of this development. The company says the 6030LR has a
longer reach than the 2000 or standard Safelok-style clips,
a higher toe load and a higher fatigue limit. The company
has also introduced two products in response to industry
needs. The first, the Amsted RPS Under Tie Pad (UTP) by
edilon)(sendra, consists of elastic polymer layers affixed or
integrated on the underside of the concrete or wood ties for
use in ballasted track to prevent degradation, protect railroad
structures and provide noise and vibration attenuation.
“The benefits of our UTPs include: easy in-plant installation, reduction of vertical track modulus, resistance to
deterioration in harsh environments, extended life of ballasted track bridge decks and prolonged tie life,” said John
Stout, director of sales.
The second new product is the Loadmaster Timber Tie
Fasteners. Amsted RPS said its engineers took the technology of the Loadmaster and adapted the product for use on
open-deck timber bridges. The company says Loadmaster
Timber Tie Fasteners can be used to match the track mod24	</p>
                                    
                                        <p>Markets for the company’s various direct fixation fastening
systems in late 2012 and 2013 continue to slowly improve.
Per L.B. Foster, passage of the latest U.S. transportation
legislation, Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century
(MAP-21), last summer, gave some stability to federal funding of transit projects across the U.S. However, as this bill
expires in September 2014, it does not give the length of time
wanted as the successor to the six-year SAFETEA-LU and
it kept funding essentially flat rather than increase spending,
but it will encourage a number of projects to come forward.
In addition, mass transit ridership in general and the use of
heavy, commuter and light-rail modes in particular, continues to grow. According to the American Public Transportation Association, ridership on those three forms of rail grew
by 1.6 percent in 2012 and had increased in 10 consecutive
quarters before slipping slightly the past two quarters. Use of
mass transit continues to expand as U.S. demographics shift
towards a younger population.
Specifically, the company’s Transit Products team participated in a number of projects in supplying Direct Fixation
Fasteners to New York City Transit, Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART)
and other agencies.
Last year, the company also won the largest award of
business in L.B. Foster history for rail and related accessories for Honolulu Area Rapid Transit. Included in that
award are approximately 170,000 Direct Fixation Fasteners. Shipment of those fasteners will begin later this year,
continuing into 2014. L.B. Foster worked closely with the
contractor, Kiewit/Kobayhashi, on this project.
The company also continues to develop new fastening technologies to meet changing industry demands. Per
Korhan Ciloglu, R&amp;D manager, Rail Products, stray currents in track cause numerous headaches for transit operators, including interference and premature track degradation due to corrosion.
“Based on feedback from our customers in North America and abroad, we are in the midst of developing new solutions that will mitigate stray currents. These solutions will
provide significant operating and maintenance benefits to our
customers,” said Ciloglu.
The Transit Products team also continues to work quite
closely with other product teams within L.B. Foster to bring
new designs forward. Resilient Ties were supplied to BART
with the support of the CXT® Concrete Ties team. And utilizing the unique talents and technical consulting capabilities
of the UK team in Sheffield, the company continues to establish a growing presence in global transit markets. As a result
of steadily growing markets and internal collaboration to

and to improve those already on the market. An example is
the patented Evergrip™ Spike. Since its introduction, we’ve
made numerous improvements to extend the service life and
improve production times for our customers,” said Dave
Barry, vice president-sales at Lewis Bolt &amp; Nut Company.
Barry named several of these improvements, including a
refined point for installation ease, the addition of a double
head for removing with a spike puller and increasing the
strength properties.
Realizing that some customers prefer to use typical
AREMA square hole tie plates, Lewis Bolt used the Evergrip concept and applied to it to the new Permagrip™
Spike meant to be used in square holes.
“With an 11/16-inch diameter and lengths to 6-3/4
inches, the Permagrip really is filling an important need by
offering a tremendous improvement in gauge control without the need to change to round hole plates,” said Barry.
“Like the Evergrip, the patented Permagrip can be driven
or turned in. The built in fins lock the spike in place, thus
preventing backout. The part is now being produced with
or without a 13-degree beveled washer to go against the rail
base or to use in gauge holes.”
Citing customers’ need for quick product turnaround,
Barry points out the company has expanded operations by
adding primarily warehouse space, which will help the company to inventory more material to meet the demand.</p>

                                        <p>Pandrol USA says demand is strong for high performance
elastic fastening systems.
“North American railroads continue to improve their
track systems and increase their capacity to take advantage
of the benefits provided by the lower fuel costs to move
freight by rail and to meet the needs of shifts in demand,
including the increasing need to transport crude oil by rail
as a result of the boom caused by the availability of shale
oil,” said Pandrol.
The company says its fastening systems are finding a
place among track in heavy-haul freight service in territories with high degrees of curvature and grade. According
to Pandrol, railroads are looking for fastening systems that
can withstand the challenges presented by these operating
conditions, providing both the holding power and durability
required. Additionally, Pandrol says the stiffer track modulus
provided by its fastenings increase locomotive fuel economy.
Pandrol USA also notes it continues to upgrade and
improve its product line and its manufacturing facilities, such
as adopting changes in its fastening manufacturing facility
that streamlined its production and increased efficiency.
The company has also invested a significant amount of
money in a captive plastics plant located near its facility in
Bridgeport, N.J. This investment has added machinery to
increase production of tie pads and insulators, as well as
undertake a research and development program to determine
the best plastic materials for insulators and pads in differing
operating conditions. Both railroads and resin manufacturers
are providing assistance to this program, which has involved</p>

                                        <p>the development of new testing rigs and new and revised
material formulations. Pandrol says the development program
is expected to result in parts designed to better meet tough
operating conditions, as well as increasing the life for the plastic parts that are an integral part of today’s fastening systems.
“Pandrol has always been on the forefront of development of new fastening systems for the railroad industry. We
are committed to a program of new product development
and the constant review of our existing products to modify
them where appropriate,” said the company.
“As part of this ongoing effort, we are currently making improvements to the Pandrol VICTOR plate system for
wood ties that has seen a rapid increase in market share. The
improvements, which include modifications to the shoulder
design, strengthen the system and alleviate torque and turning issues that could occur under severe operating conditions. The Pandrol VICTOR system combines the durability
of an AREA tie plate with the benefits of resilient fastenings.
The flat tie plate provides a bearing area 37 percent greater
than existing tie plates for resilient fastenings,” said Pandrol.
“The use of Pandrol’s fastenings provides all of the advantages of resilient fastenings – holding power, prevention of
rail rollover and reduced maintenance. Testing, with 39-tonaxle-loads, has shown a five-fold decrease in gauge widening
when using resilient fastenings on wood ties. The Pandrol
VICTOR system is demonstrating its value on bridges and
curves with significant annual tonnage.”</p>

the same easy installation to other applications. GageLok 3/4
Plus and GageLok 3/4 PL were developed for use in roll plates,
switch stands and other plates with round holes up to one inch.
GageLok 3/4 LS was developed with a longer shank for use
with insulating bushings on electric tracks systems.”

gives the company a centrally-located facility to supply
North American railroads and contractors with its rail fasteners, while also housing the company’s product development, testing and demonstration centers to drive Rail Forge
innovation and quality that is required by the rail industry.
“The rail industry is driven by performance and safety
requirements and our products help them achieve those
goals,” said Ishaug. “For example, using GageLok 11/16
to replace cut spikes allows railroads to significantly reduce
gauge and rail rollover issues at a very low cost, improving
both performance and safety for our customers. These fastening applications require the proper combination of strength
and ductility in the fastener. We work closely with track standards engineers, suppliers and independent testing laboratories on our product design, material selection and production
processes to ensure the reliability of GageLok fasteners.”</p>

                                        <p>Vossloh Fastening Systems, part of the Vossloh Group,
relies on research and development rather than a “one-size
fits all” approach to fastener design.
“Vossloh Fastening Systems is constantly assessing our
products, how they perform in our lab and in the field and
what we can do to achieve a lower life-cycle cost for our
partners. With systems in more than 100 countries and on
applications from extreme heavy haul to high speed and
urban transit operations, we are educated on all types of
operations and have helped develop cost-effective solu-</p>

                                        <p>tions for all users,” said the company. “With our extensive
laboratory capabilities and constant field presence, we are
able to research the best dynamics for any applications
requirements and develop the correct system as a solution,
whether that be low-axle weight and noise suppression or
extreme heavy-haul with tight curves and steep grades.”
The company points to its W 40 HH, which was specifically designed for the extreme U.S. heavy-haul market, as
one example of its focused research efforts. According to
Vossloh, the W 40 HH, maintains the toe load forces longer
and enhances the lateral and vertical holding forces, while
providing higher fatigue limits to ensure a longer working
life and reduced life-cycle costs.
“While accomplishing these goals, we were also able to
increase the horizontal forces to ensure a higher level of rail
creep resistance. We also developed new support components that help enhance the performance of the whole system and extend its life cycle and reliability,” said Vossloh.
Vossloh Fastening Systems believes all its products
achieve the goal of high reliability and provide the best performing systems, while controlling the cost of ownership.
“[Our partners have] asked for the most reliable, robust
and easiest to maintain systems possible and we’ve given
them what they want,” said Vossloh. “As the market here and
internationally changes and develops, new and more complex issues to be resolved, like rail life performance, rolling
contact fatigue and its relation to the track structure influence and tie life issues, like rail seat abrasion issues, Vossloh
will continue to be on the cutting edge of new developments
to resolve or minimize the impact of these issues.”</p>

replacing,” said Wayne Weszka, vice president, rail products, Hanson Pipe &amp; Precast. “We would like to see
crossings put on a schedule like railroad ties and rail to
improve the transitions between the tracks and the actual
road surface.”
He notes the driving factor is funding to improve
the signalization areas, however, he says there needs to
be more funding to improve the actual grade-crossing
surface using more efficient crossings that have longer
life expectancies.
“The cost to close a railroad crossing is increasing every
year and it is harder to get a complete road closure; longer-life crossing surfaces would help solve this problem,”
he explained.
In the future, he says he sees a need for a modular railroad crossing that can handle higher volumes and higher
train speeds to keep up with today’s higher-speed trains.
The company notes that it is close to coming out with this
new product.
Currently, Hanson Pipe &amp; Precast offers its new 16-ft.
by 8-ft. modular crossing and is working on a high-speed
module. Hanson’s crossing products have a textured, skidresistant surface.</p>

of HiRAIL Corporation, says that he feels the goal would
be to have as few grade crossings as possible.
“Where it is not feasible to eliminate or grade separate a
crossing, the major modifications would be in the crossing
warning devices more than the surface,” he explained.
The company now offers a rail seal product that can
accommodate all types of rail fastenings and it can be
installed on concrete ties, as well as timber. It is manufactured
in varying lengths so 18-inch tie spacing is not required.
HiRAIL manufactures a complete line of rubber gradecrossing surfaces including Hi-Rail, Pede-Strail and HiRAIL
Rail Seal (RS). HiRAIL crossings are a green product, manufactured from recycled vehicle tires and can be recycled at
the end of their useful life.
HiRAIL full-depth rubber grade-crossing systems are
said to provide a smooth, safe and attractive crossing surface for motor vehicles. They are manufactured to accommodate most common rail sizes, rail fastenings and wood,

Pede-Strail is a pedestrian crossing surface that meets
ADA requirements. It has all the features of HiRAIL
full-depth rubber and comes with a raised diamond surface for pedestrian stability.
HiRAIL RS is a rubber rail seal product that works in
conjunction with asphalt or poured-in-place concrete crossings and is manufactured to fit most common rail sizes on
timber or concrete ties using all types of rail fastening.
Barry says he sees the highest demand from the Class 1s.
“Most likely because they have the greatest number of
crossings; we also see a large demand from transit and commuter rail systems.”</p>

meeting Class 1 specifications, including BNSF, Canadian National, Union Pacific and Kansas City Southern.
It also produces generic Koppers specs for full-depth
crossings and panels with asphalt in the center. The company offers clients wood crossings that are solid timber panels to cover 8-ft. 6-inch, 9-ft. and 10-ft. crossties or single
panels for asphalt centers. Koppers also produces generic

with transits and with industrial applications.
KSA is a PCI and AAR M-1003 certified facility
located in Sciotoville, Ohio, which has been in operation
since 1992. The KSA concrete grade-crossing design
is a full-width, full-depth system that accommodates
rail sizes from 112-lb. to 141-lb. rail. Its panels are
designed for both timber and concrete crossties and
are manufactured with a heavy steel angle frame, highstrength 7,000-psi concrete and come with attached rubber flangeway, bearing pads, deflectors and lag screws.</p>

which is a 136-lb. mainline crossing surface, entered fullscale production in late summer 2013.
The solid panel design includes skid-resistant surface
and extends the composite material into the flangeway
to provide a more cost-effective product, says Linda
Thomas, president of the company. Lifting devices are
included to assure efficient installation and easy removal for track maintenance.
Recently, LT Resources supplied approximately 1,900
track feet of ENDURANCE-XL Composite Crossings,
which were manufactured using a proprietary engineered
recycled plastics formulation for the CSX Intermodal Terminal in Worcester, Mass. More than 700 bales of plastic
waste, or approximately 233 metric tons of plastic materials,
were recycled on this project, rather than disposing of the
waste material in landfills.

                                        <p>“Crossing business is off to a very good start this year,” said
Mark Mottola, national sales manager at Omega Industries,
Inc. “We ended 2012 with our busiest year to date and
expect 2013 to be even better. Class 1 railroad orders from
BNSF, Union Pacific and Canadian Pacific, along with
Amtrak and a host of large transit projects, are pushing
sales higher each year.”
As a result, Omega is in the process of updating its four
manufacturing facilities to keep up with crossing- panel
demand. The goal is to have annual production capacity of
150,000 track feet (28 miles) of precast panels by the end
of this year.
As concrete technology continues to evolve, Omega is
constantly keeping an eye on new materials and techniques
to help build a better product. The company is now using
fiber reinforced concrete in all of its panels. Not as an alternative to rebar reinforcement, but in addition to traditional
reinforcing methods.
“The fiber improves panel durability, impact and abrasion resistance and reduces damage from freeze/thaw,”
Mottola noted. “This adds a little to up front material
costs, but helps offset the higher cost of having to prematurely replace a crossing.”
In addition to manufacturing and supplying crossing
panels, Omega says it has been taking a more active role in
crossing design.
“Many customers have come to rely on us to help field
measure and design their more difficult crossing projects,”
he explained. “There are many techniques we are able to
recommend that will increase crossing longevity.”</p>

standard concrete crossings.
Bob Cigrang, vice president of sales and marketing,
says he has noticed a trend in specialized rubber blends for
flange areas and that transits are driving the most demand.
However, he notes that budgets seem to have decreased
this year since many cities are struggling financially.
As high-speed rail gains interest year-to-year, Cigrang
says the company is currently working on quotes for various projects.</p>
                                    
                                        <p>Polycorp Ltd.</p>
                                    
                                        <p>Polycorp Ltd. has developed a new Removable Railseal
crossing system for use in concrete road surfaces and highwear areas.
“The system allows the rubber railseal to be removed,
repairs to be made and the rubber reinserted in a fraction
of the time it takes for traditional repair work,” said Brad
Bedford, technical sales coordinator. “This new design
allows for overnight rail and fastener repairs to be made
without costly detours and rush hour road closures.”
Polycorp manufactures products for every type of
surface, rail size and track construction, including traditional railseal to precast concrete panels.
The rise in transit expansion has led Polycorp to develop a complete line of rail and special trackwork isolation</p>
                                    
                                        <p>products. The company’s patent-pending TrackJacket
Encapsulation System allows for stray current and vibration mitigation throughout the whole rail network.
“The rise in fuel costs throughout the world is taking
people off the roads and onto the rails,” Bedford noted.
“This has resulted in an all-time high in transit ridership.
This increased ridership has seen the payback shortened
for transit expansion in major city centers, leading to
immediate launches of shovel-ready projects. Many of
these expansion projects are utilizing Polycorp’s line of
electrical and vibration isolating Epflex railboot, Rail Seal
and TrackJacket products to improve their system’s performance and reduce future maintenance.”
The intricate track construction of high-speed rail
requires a number of elastomeric products be used in the
track structure, Bedford says and noted that these products facilitate vibration dampening inside the train, as well
as the surrounding areas. Because of this, Polycorp has
refined its line of elastomeric track products for supply.</p>

                                        <p>Stella-Jones Corporation now offers a Solid Full-Width
Timber Panel Crossing for 10-ft. crossties, along with
the traditional sized panels for 8-ft., 6-inch and 9-ft.
crossties. Another new feature for Stella-Jones crossings
includes dap(s) that will accommodate MSR or Pandrol
plates with E-clips. Additionally, the company can manufacture crossing panels for turnouts, if detailed drawings are provided.
The company has three basic styles of crossing surfaces: The Full-Width/Full-Depth Panel style for 8-ft. 6-inch,
9-ft. and 10-ft. crossties, which cover the entire crosstie;
the Standard Timber and Asphalt style with two 10-inch
field side timbers doweled together and one 10-inch
gauge side of the rail timbers and the Single/Single style
crossing with a 10-inch gauge side timber and a 10-inch
field side timber.
“It appears that more customers are coming back to the
timber crossings,” noted Jim Jordie, regional sales manager.
“I believe it may be due to the fact that we have not seen
huge increases in the cost of crossing timbers and therefore, they remain a good value for the dollars invested.”</p>

STEP-SAFE®, work as an integrated safety system with
our BODAN® Grade Crossing,” explained Karen Dinitz,
marketing and communications director for TRANSPO
INDUSTRIES.
BODAN uses a bridge design concept where the vehicle
axle loads are transferred directly to the rails. Panel tests
show they are capable of withstanding loads in excess of
44,000 lbs. Its welded steel cage reinforcements support
HS 25 traffic loads and the high-friction granular surfacing
material provides a skid-resistant surface. BODAN’s precast polymer concrete is impervious to salt, diesel fuel and
moisture and offers optional surface-mounted LED warning lights, she notes.
Dinitz says there is a new focus on pedestrian and bicycle
safety and because of this, the use of color pavement on and
through the crossing is commanding new interest.

contract for maintenance along the Alameda Corridor, which includes track,
signal, communications and right-ofway maintenance. As Larry Mahon,
area operations manager for Balfour
Beatty Rail, says, one of the biggest
challenges facing track inspection
along the corridor is allotting enough
time to perform track inspections.
“On some days, the heavy volume
of traffic makes thorough and complete
inspections more difficult than usual,”
36	</p>
                                    
                                        <p>said Mahon. “The Alameda Corridor
is a three-mainline corridor. Because of
Federal Railroad Administration (FRA)
regulations, we can’t inspect all three
tracks at once unless there’s a second
qualified inspector in the vehicle and
the track centers are no more than 39
feet apart. On the Alameda Corridor,
the track centers are 15 feet apart, but
there are 143 power switches and each
has to be inspected monthly. With traffic the way it is, it’s a challenge making
thorough track inspections and walking
to each switch.
“There’s no substitute for good visual
track inspections. Geometry cars will find
things the eye may miss, but they can’t
find things that a walking person will. It
all comes down to working with the dispatching center to make sure everyone
understands the requirements so the
FRA regulations are met,” said Mahon.”</p>

                                        <p>Two main challenges surround track
inspection, according to ENSCO, Inc.
The first is scheduling critical track
inspection activities with limited track</p>
                                    
                                        <p>time without impacting revenue service. The second is identifying rail
breaks prior to a derailment.
“With high traffic volumes on freight
lines and the growth of passenger services around the country, as well as ever
increasing demands placed on railroad
workforces, the time available for the
range of various inspections required is
becoming more difficult to schedule,”
said Eric Sherrock, senior staff engineer at ENSCO. “With regards to track
components, the identification of rail
breaks prior to a derailment is of critical
importance to the industry, especially
with the impending implementation of
positive train control and the eventual
decrease in reliance on track circuits.
Rail breaks continue to be identified as
a leading cause of a significant number
of track-related derailments.“
ENSCO notes that recent procurements by railroads indicate a trend towards comprehensive track inspection
in a single pass from vehicles equipped
with several complimentary inspection
systems. The company’s range of track
inspection systems can be integrated

                                        <p>on a single vehicle to provide comprehensive automated track inspections.
In 2012, ENSCO delivered a full-sized
self-propelled inspection vehicle to
Washington Metropolitan Area Transit
Authority capable of simultaneously
measuring track geometry, rail profile,
platform edges, as well as third rail geometry and temperature. The vehicle is
also able to record video and thermal
images of the tunnels and conduct ultrasonic rail-flaw inspections, all while
capturing foot-by-foot track measurements in a single pass.
ENSCO’s Comprehensive Track
Inspection Vehicle (CTIV) is a hi-rail
based platform that allows for track geometry and rail profile measurement
along with machine vision-based assessment of joint bars and track bed components including ties and fasteners.
ENSCO says it also offers a suite of
autonomous inspection systems that
provide high quality inspection results
from revenue service vehicles with minimal direct involvement from operators.
“One of the most significant advantages of autonomous inspection
technology is that every movement of
the host train offers an opportunity to
evaluate the track, allowing for more
frequent inspections without track time
being consumed by dedicated inspection vehicles. The use of autonomous
inspection technologies can result in
earlier detection of track defects, allowing for maintenance practices to be preventative rather than reactive, ultimately reducing the number of track related
derailments,” said Sherrock.
ENSCO provides both the Vehicle/
Track Interaction (V/TI) Monitor
and the Autonomous Track Geometry Measurement System (ATGMS).
Currently, ENSCO has more than 250
autonomous V/TI Monitors in operation and delivered two ATGMS units
this year, including the first ever to be
deployed by a Class 1 railroad.
“Autonomous V/TI Monitors have
the ability to capture locations of a broken rail by measuring the response of
a vehicle’s unsprung mass to the track
and reporting the locations of severe
impacts to end users. ENSCO’s machine vision-based inspection systems
are able to capture high-resolution images of track components, analyze these
images for cracks and breaks and alert
users to their existence. Both of these
approaches can be an effective means

                                        <p>“In 2005, railroads dismissed as novelty, the thought of using machine vision
technology for tie inspection and grading,” said Lynn Turner, vice president
marketing and sales for Georgetown
Rail Equipment Company (GREX).
“Today, GREX’s Aurora Automated
Tie Inspection system is widely accepted among America’s railroads as a
planning tool for tie replacement and
deterioration trending models. Using
the technology of high-speed cameras
and lasers, Aurora is state-of-the-art tie
condition inspection and reporting.”
Turner continued, “GREX develops exclusive tie grading models for
each customer using sophisticated
algorithms that embed unique grading characteristics specific to that customer. These unique characteristics are
identified during a walking calibration
process with the human tie inspector.
Aurora then ‘learns’ these grading attributes and begins to mimic the expert
inspector, mirroring the grading results.
This output, in a 3-D digital track image along with the statistical analysis of
tie condition, allows critical and thorough reporting and assigns each tie an
exact GPS location signature. Incorporating rolling 39-foot defects, joint tie
defects and clusters of failed ties into
customized reports are typical of customer presented challenges that GREX
engineers have developed solutions for.
It is no coincidence that customers who
have invested the most effort into Aurora have realized the best performance.”
Just as a walking inspector requires a
clear view of the track to perform at an
optimum level, so does Aurora in order
to make an accurate assessment of tie
condition. Turner says keeping that view
free of obstructions, such as ballast covered ties, is a common challenge.
“Originally, Aurora was unable to
distinguish these ballasted ties. With
ballast coverage being one of the most
prevalent reasons for track obstruction,
GREX focused on improving Aurora’s
ability to better handle these instances.
When Aurora now encounters ballast
covered ties, it has been taught to recognize the obstructing ballast and identify the areas of ties that are still visible.
Using a percentage of visibility calculation, Aurora can provide an assessment</p>
                                    
                                        <p>based on what it can see. Plate cut can
also be measured and made a part of
the overall assessment,” said Turner.
“Every challenge that Aurora overcomes has a positive customer impact.
Each time, the system’s robustness is
improved and the quality of data is refined. Our customers give testimony to
the progress Aurora has made and are
confident in our inspection abilities, deploying Aurora in areas that were once
deemed too obstructed or unknown to
inspect with automation. Aurora engineers will continue to solve the challenges that customers identify but Aurora’s acceptance has proven that it is
here to stay, providing accuracy and
repeatability at more than 40 miles per
hour, day or night,” said Turner.</p>

                                        <p>Joe Palese, senior director, engineering
&amp; technology at Harsco Rail, notes that
track inspection needs to take into account safety and maintenance.
“Thus, inspection is first focused
around those critical components and
areas that lend themselves to decreasing the risk of failure and, subsequently, increasing safety. The data gathered
during the inspection of any component can also be turned into a wealth
of information for understanding component degradation and failure. This
allows for developing maintenance
practices to prolong the life of the components. Addressing the most critical components first is of paramount
importance. This needs to be accomplished with an effort to keep costs as
low as possible,” said Palese.
Palese points to Harsco Rail’s Automated Switch Inspection Vehicle (ASIV)
as one approach to incorporating safety
and maintenance into track inspection.
The company says the ASIV is a hi-rail
based turnout inspection system that
utilizes proven inspection technology to
focus on the rail and geometry portions
of the turnout, which allows for cost effective inspection of the critical safety
components of the turnout.
“Traditional methods are used to
inspect the remaining portions. Once
cost effective production measurements
systems become available for these remaining portions, they will be added to
the ASIV. Research is currently under
way to address this,” said Palese.
Another issue Palese mentions regarding inspection is speed.

customers require inspection to occur
at track speeds. This is sometimes not
possible with current inspection technologies. Customers want inspection at
track speed and for it to be autonomous
as opposed to dedicated inspection,” he
said. “Harsco Rail has been investigating
and developing technologies that can be
deployed on hi-rail vehicles for easy on/

investigating deploying these systems on
other work equipment (grinders, tampers and UTVs) to take advantage of

                                        <p>Holland LP says a challenge in track
measurement is the validation of rail cant
measured by track geometry test vehicles.
Holland’s TrackSTAR® fleet measures rail cant along with track geometry
in one foot increments. Bob Madderom,
vice president and general manager with
Holland LP, says it has become standard practice for railroads to measure
and report on rail cant exceptions from
automated track geometry cars.
“Essentially, we now have the capability to identify rail cant exceptions in
the normal course of our reporting for
all measured track,” said Madderom.
“Rail cant measurement has become a
very important measurement of condition of track. Differential plate cutting
on wood ties in heavy tonnage or poorly maintained track can be a problem.
Also, rail cant variation on concrete ties
is an effective way to identify potential
areas of worn pads, or worse, rail seat
deterioration (RSD).
Madderom says rail cant variation
is effective in identifying RSD on concrete ties and points to recent FRA
track safety standards (TSS 213.234)
that became effective in July 2012 and
require the automated measurement of
concrete tie track for indications of potential RSD.
“Although geometry cars have effective systems to measure rail cant
and provide exception reporting, until
recently, there have been no manual inspection tools to easily measure existing
condition cant in track. Field inspectors were dependent on mostly visual
inspection and GPS or MP + footage
information from reports to try to find
cant problems,” said Madderom. “Recently, Holland completed the design

inspector’s track gauge measurement
tools in weight and size, the patented
RCMT can provide direct read out
of existing rail cant in a few seconds.
The RCMT eliminates the guesswork
of where rail cant exceptions begin and
end and provides immediate feedback
to the track maintenance person.”</p>

                                        <p>“The biggest challenge for our customers in track inspection is having a means
to measure vertical track deflection under heavy-axle-loads, which gives them
an indication of track formation condition,” said G. Robert Newman, business development engineer for TÜV
Rheinland Rail Sciences, Inc., which
partnered with MRail on a system to
take on this challenge.
“Railroads need to quantify this
value over sections of track at a normal train speed and they need to make
this measurement often in order to determine the trends. This in turn gives
them a fast, simple method to evaluate
the condition of the track formation to
plan further inspection and track maintenance planning,” said Newman.
“The new MRail System, provides
a simple measurement in inches, indicating total vertical track deflection
under heavy-axle-load. The measurement can be made unattended and
at normal train speed for each track
section. Because the data is recorded
and transmitted remotely at a high
speed on a revenue train, no track
time is required. This allows the railroad to take frequent measurements
to establish trends in formation con-</p>

sales for NxGen Rail Services, a Sasser
Family Holdings Company, believes
that as railroad maintenance activities
continue their evolution from reactive
to proactive, condition based maintenance of track and rolling stock will
provide significant savings, as well as
improvements in safety for the railroads in the future.
“The challenge for the track inspection industry is therefore to provide the
quality data required to meet this step
change,” said Grant. “Accurate technologies are now available that can be
used, or combined, to test and measure
almost all of the required parameters
and components. The issue is to understand how to combine and apply them
to provide the information in the format that the industry needs.
“At NxGen Rail Services, we have
met this challenge by integrating the
different technologies onto a common
platform that travels at line speed, providing the maintenance planners with
a holistic view of their asset in near real
time. This provides a fast, non-intrusive solution. Speed is also necessary
to be able to cover the huge mileage
of track that make up the rail networks
with an adequate frequency, but with
a minimum level of investment in systems. However, more speed generates
a greater frequency of defect detections, so our systems have also been
tailored to use machine intelligence to
understand which defects are important and generate accurate reports,”
said Grant.

                                        <p>Grant says the system gives precise
locations of defects, enabling planners to examine them from different
points of view to better understand
the causes of the problems and design
better solutions.
“For example, a cluster of missing
fasteners might be the result of a geometry defect or dipped joint, caused
by an inadequate layer of ballast sitting on an unstable track bed or a
bad transition from one rail profile
to another or a combination of both.
Multiplexing technologies to understand the root cause means that the
repair can be designed to resolve the
problem definitively, whereas just replacing the fasteners and tamping the
track would only have a temporary
effect, that will need to be repeated
again and again as the consequence
of the underlying defect continues to
reappear,” said Grant.</p>

                                        <p>Tom Keogh, president of Rail Radar,
recognizes that while track inspection
is essential, it consumes both financial</p>

                                        <p>and human resources and sometimes
more importantly, track capacity.
“One of the largest issues dealing
with inspection of track is that of acquiring sufficient time on the track to
conduct detailed surveys. One of the
main issues is most areas in most need
of inspection are ones experiencing
highest traffic densities. Conventional
tie assessment requires either walking
tie inspectors and/or image based systems to assess ties and related components. These methods are challenged
by subjective interpretations and/or
features, which obscure analysis (color
changes, debris, ballast, etc.) and can
be incorrectly identified as defects.”
Rail Radar has developed a three-dimensional (3-D) tie assessment system
that the company says improves upon
existing 2-D technologies. According
to Rail Radar, the 3-D tie assessment
results show improved in-situ tie condition data (dimensional correct 3-D tie
cross-sections); allows data to be collected at increased speed; has enhanced
tie processing with improved quality assessment methods and algorithms; has</p>
                                    
                                        <p>improved unambiguous feature identification, which reduce false positives;
incorporates vertical height information to improve feature identification
and classification and has enhanced
feature classification algorithms that
use 3-D feature models to improve reliability and speed.
“Technology has evolved and the
benefits of incorporating automation
through machine vision into inspection processes are well documented
and proven. Rail Radar’s 3-D system
uses industry proven ‘machine vision’
techniques to improve the efficiency,
effectiveness and objectivity of the
track inspection process. Rail Radar’s
3-D system capitalizes proven technology first through data acquisition,
second through image analysis and
third through data analysis. Rail Radar has a proven ‘track’ record working with major railroads to ensure experienced tie inspection processes
and thresholds are upheld. The enhanced quality of data collected with
Rail Radar’s 3-D system ensures this
happens,” said Keogh.</p>

National Railroad Construction and
Maintenance Association (NRC)
Chairman Terry Benton of Colo Railroad
Builders, NRC President Chuck Baker and
NRC Operations Manager Ashley Bosch
about recent history and what they believe is
in the future for the NRC.</p>
                                    
                                        <p>RT&amp;S: Terry, you are in your second
year as NRC Chairman. What goals
have you established for the NRC to
be accomplished during your tenure
and are you making progress towards
those goals?
Terry Benton: My goals for the organization
are to continue promoting the importance of
the NRC organization to the membership by:
•	Listening to our members and helping
determine where the NRC can assist
in meeting their needs, whether in construction and maintenance of track,
structures, communication and signals
or any of the other disciplines that the
NRC represents;
•	Continuing to maintain the momentum
of the NRC’s current legislative and
safety initiatives and
•	Promoting the NRC to non-members
and customers to expand the membership of the NRC in order to build
a stronger voice in Washington and to
more fully represent the entire industry.
The NRC will continue to provide support, leadership and advocacy for the industry in the safety and legislative/regulatory
areas. I have been building on the legacy of
leadership left by Past Chairmen Jim Perkins
of Loram, Jon McGrath of McGrath LLC,
Manny Ramirez of Mass Electric, Rick Eber40	</p>
                                    
                                        <p>sold of Herzog Services, Larry Laurello of
Delta Railroad Construction and Scott Brace
of RailWorks and will continue to grow the
organization as my predecessors have.
NRC membership has grown more than
75 percent in the past six years, from 184
Member Companies in 2006 to 326 members in 2012. We have been joined by 65
new members in the past 12 months alone.
Our Membership Committee, chaired by
Stephanie Freeman of Coleman Industrial
Construction, is doing a great job.
RT&amp;S: You mention expanding the
membership. What benefits does the
NRC offer to its current members and
potential new ones?
Benton: The Membership Committee and
our Washington D.C. staff, including NRC
President Chuck Baker, Director of Operations Matt Ginsberg, Operations Manager
Ashley Bosch and Grassroots Coordinator Tabitha Layman Narvaiz, have done an
excellent job of identifying and recruiting
companies in our industry who will benefit
from being NRC members. The NRC exists
to support rail contractors and suppliers,
expand their business opportunities and protect them from harmful laws and regulations.
We are the only organization entirely dedicated to this purpose. We keep a close eye on
all issues that could affect our membership
positively or negatively and we vigorously
defend our position in front of legislative and
regulatory bodies.
Ashley Bosch: We have a long list of
specific benefits we provide to our members, which are detailed on our website
at www.nrcma.org. Membership includes
discounted registration at the annual</p>
                                    
                                        <p>NRC conference and exhibition and a full
company listing in both the printed and
online versions of the NRC membership
directory, which is distributed to Class 1,
shortline and regional railroads, as well as
executives at rail transit and commuter rail
agencies throughout the country. Membership also includes access to the Contractor Safety Award contest, the Annual
Railroad Construction and Maintenance
Equipment Auction and inclusion on the
NRC’s bulletin distribution list, which is
full of useful information for rail contractors and suppliers.
At the moment, well over 350 rail construction, supply and professional service
companies are members of the NRC, which
as Terry said, is up more than 75 percent in
the past six years. We attribute most of that
growth to word of mouth, the NRC Membership Committee and our board members
who have been the NRC’s best evangelists.
We have an impressive group on the board
and they have the credibility with their colleagues to convince them to join the NRC
and support our industry.
Chuck Baker: I’d like to thank our
board members. These ladies and gentlemen do an extraordinary amount of work
to support the NRC and the rail construction industry.
Benton: The NRC is using a variety of methods to stay in touch with our
members and get our message out to the
world. In addition to constantly updating
our website at www.nrcma.org and communicating via e-mail bulletins, the NRC
has begun tweeting. I recommend following the NRC on Twitter. Just go to www.

RT&amp;S: What is the NRC doing to promote safety?
Benton: We have a very active Safety Committee. Tammy Mathews of RailWorks is our
current Safety Committee Chairwoman and
follows Ernesto Scarpitti of Delta Railroad
Construction. Tammy is an excellent representative of RailWorks, the NRC and the
industry as a whole.
The Safety Committee oversees the
Safety Training DVD program, the NRC’s
participation in the Federal Railroad Administration’s (FRA) Railroad Safety Advisory
Committee (RSAC) process, the Contractor
Safety Award contest, the NRC’s Roadway
Worker Protection training materials, the
Pocket Safety Manual, our “Tool Box Talks”
and all of the NRC’s other safety programs.
The continuing series of safety training
DVDs is led by Safety Committee member
and former Board Director John Zuspan
of Track Guy Consultants. The two most
recent DVDs in this series, Safety Around
Flash Butt Welding and Fall Protection in the
Rail Industry, were unveiled at the conference in January 2013 and are now available
to all NRC members. The entire series has
received excellent reviews and is available at
no cost to NRC members.
Safety Committee members, along with
NRC staff, represent the NRC’s interests
on FRA’s RSAC. RSAC membership and
participation enables the NRC to provide
input to the FRA as they create regulations
dealing with such key issues as minimum
training standards for railroads and contractors performing maintenance-of-way
work, drug and alcohol testing policies,
medical standards for safety-critical work-</p>

Safety Committee member and Board
Director David Armstrong of Commercial
Insurance Associates takes the lead for the
NRC on organizing the very competitive
“NRC Safe Contractor of the Year” award
contest. RT&amp;S also sponsors this contest
and helps to publicize the winners, which is
much appreciated. There are many excellent
safety programs among our membership and
this award is a valued acknowledgement of
the hard work and dedication of the leadership and safety managers of our member
companies. There were a record number of
entries in the latest contest and the winners
were announced at the conference in January, published in the March issue of RT&amp;S
and appear again in the NRC Membership
Directory. The submittals of the winning
firms, including a comprehensive outline of
their successful safety programs, were available for viewing at the conference.
The NRC also offers a Roadway Worker
Protection (RWP) training program, which
has been developed by railroad safety professionals with feedback from FRA staff. The
RWP training program, which is complimentary to NRC members and is available on
the NRC website, includes a training presentation, complete with descriptions of the 49
CFR Part 214 RWP regulations, a training
examination, an answer key and training
completion cards.
Additional safety resources offered by
the NRC to our members include the newly
updated “Tool Box Safety Talk” series, the
Pocket Safety Manual for workers to refer-</p>

safety program.
RT&amp;S: Your annual conference took
place in early January and set another
NRC conference attendance record. To
what do you attribute the success of
your conference?
Benton: Our guest speakers are a consistently impressive group of industry leaders who
address pertinent and timely issues. These are
the people conference attendees want to hear
in order to be current with the industry. The
sessions are well-attended and people are
attentive and engaged. These speakers detailing railroad and transit capital spending plans
are the core attraction of our conference.
Bosch: In addition, several other industry
associations and companies hold meetings in
conjunction with our conference, such as the
American Short Line and Regional Railroad
Association’s Legislative Policy Committee,
REMSA’s Board of Directors, the Railway
Tie Association’s Executive Committee, the
Association of Independent Passenger Rail
Operators, GoRail, Nordco, Plasser American and RailWorks.
Multiple seminars were offered at the
conference, including a legal seminar by
Burns White on “Avoiding Imputed Liability for FELA,” a contracting seminar
on “Integrated Project Teams” by R&amp;R
Contracting, an RWP Train-the-Trainer
seminar by Roadway Worker Training, Inc.,
and a passenger rail program seminar by
the North Carolina Department of Transportation, including information on current
timelines, prequalification requirements,
bidding and Buy America rules.
Baker: This brings a new group of
executives to the NRC conference, adding
to the appeal for NRC members. It also</p>

                                        <p>allows many attendees to attend the conference and deal with
other important business issues in a single trip, making the most
effective use of people’s limited time. This has worked well and we
urge other rail associations, committees, railroads, transit agencies
and state DOTs to consider coordinating their meetings and seminars with the NRC conference.
The NRC Special Awards have become a highlight at the conference, as well. These awards give NRC members an opportunity to
recognize their colleagues for exemplary work in the industry.
Finally, we had some high profile speakers this year, which helped
draw the record crowd. Congressman Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania
addressed the conference attendees in his first speech as chairman of
the House Transportation &amp; Infrastructure Committee, which was
an important moment.
RT&amp;S: Aside from the annual conference, are there other
NRC sponsored activities during the year?
Benton: Yes, we have two major events, the equipment auction
and Railroad Day on Capitol Hill. The NRC Rail Construction and
Maintenance Equipment Auction occurs each spring. [The most
recent] auction took place in conjunction with the Union Pacific
auction at the Blackmon Auctions Facility in Little Rock, Ark., and it
was our biggest one ever. Blackmon Auctions was the host and auctioneer and did a fantastic job.
Bosch: We were pleased with the quantity and quality of
donated and consigned equipment. Most of the equipment at the
auction is consigned by members and a portion of those proceeds</p>
                                    
                                        <p>go to the NRC Safety, Training and Education Fund. The fund
benefits our membership and the industry as a whole and is the
main source of funding for the Safety Training DVD program. And
some of the equipment is actually donated by railroads or contractors to the NRC, with 100 percent of those proceeds going to the
safety program. Balfour Beatty Rail, Railway Equipment Services,
Delta Railroad Construction and Cahaba Truck and Equipment
each donated significant pieces to the auction this year and we owe
them a debt of gratitude.
Baker: The Auction Committee has been doing great work on
this event and at the previous auctions.
Blackmon Auctions is our auctioneer every year and they do a
great job. The equipment at the auction typically includes air compressors, brush cutters, spikers, pickup trucks, hi-rail trucks, cranes, rail
threaders, spike pullers, tie inserters and removers, tampers, crib consolidators, log loaders, adzers, pre-gaugers, speedswings, anchor and
clip applicators, rollers, cribbers, swing loaders, etc.
Benton: The NRC is also a major sponsor and organizer of the
annual Railroad Day on Capitol Hill event in Washington, D.C.,
along with the AAR, ASLRRA, REMSA, RSI, RSSI and RTA. Each
year, many of our member companies are represented at meetings
with members of Congress and their staff in order to present our side
of the story on major issues affecting the railroad industry. There are
many issues in Washington, D.C., that directly affect our businesses,
such as tax credits to incentivize railroad infrastructure investment,
major grant programs, such as Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) and High Speed Intercity Passenger Rail programs, regulatory changes under consideration at the
Surface Transportation Board and truck size and weight issues. It’s
important to have the representation provided by Chuck Baker and
the NRC’s government affairs staff, but it’s equally important for
each of us contractors and suppliers to keep up on the issues and to
directly contact our representatives and senators, to let them know
that their constituents care deeply about these issues. It provides contractors and suppliers an excellent opportunity to spend time with
their railroad customers. I encourage everybody to visit our website
or contact the NRC’s office to learn how to participate and also to
participate in Railroad Day on the Hill next year.
Baker: This year’s Railroad Day on the Hill in March was a big
success, and the next event is tentatively set for March 2014 in Washington, D.C. Please plan to join us in D.C.
RT&amp;S: Speaking of Congress, tell us more about the NRC’s
Grassroots Program and why a railroad contractor or supplier would want to host their member of Congress?
Baker: Because it’s more effective to “show and tell” than simply
“tell,” the NRC’s Grassroots Program was created to invite members of Congress to visit NRC member facilities and construction
project sites. These visits give the members of Congress firsthand
knowledge of the rail industry and demonstrate how rail contractors
and suppliers are positively affecting the rail industry and the local
and national economy. NRC member companies gain positive publicity, foster good relationships with their congressional members
and build strong contacts for the NRC to utilize when advocating
for rail industry issues on Capitol Hill. It’s a win-win. These congressional visits are coordinated and executed by the NRC staff with
little work required by the host company. Contact Tabitha Layman

RT&amp;S: What are the NRC’s legislative
priorities right now?
Baker: We have been working hard to try
to get an extension of the 45G shortline railroad rehabilitation tax credit, which expired
at the end of 2013. Two bills have been
introduced in Congress, HR721 and S411,
which would extend the credit through 2016
to provide the long-term planning certainty
necessary to maximize private-sector transportation infrastructure investment. This is
a crucial piece of legislation to help maximize rehabilitation spending in the shortline
industry. The credit provides a 50-percent
tax credit to shortline railroads for investing in their infrastructure, capped at $3,500
per mile owned. This results in more than
$300 million per year of additional capital
investment by shortline railroads, much of
which is contracted out to NRC members
or spent on materials and equipment from
NRC suppliers.
The NRC’s contractor and supplier members have been crucial in helping
the shortline railroads build up record cosponsorship numbers among representatives
and senators. In the 112th Congress, well
over half of the House (256 representatives)
and more than half of the Senate (51 senators) co-sponsored the legislation, which
is extraordinary. So far this year, we’re at
88 representatives and nine senators as cosponsors, and counting.
The NRC also continues to make the
case to Congress against an increase in the
size and weight of trucks that are allowed
on the highways. We were pleased that the
MAP-21 surface transportation reauthorization bill passed in 2012 directed the
USDOT to study the issue before making
any changes to these limits. Heavy trucks
are already subsidized and increasing their
weight and length would increase that subsidy and allow them to compete unfairly
against the privately-financed freight railroads. Bigger and heavier trucks are unsafe
and unwise – they’re bad for the roads and
bad for the rail industry. The American public is solidly against them and Congress was
wise to drop the idea.
We are also actively supporting efforts by
the freight railroads to maintain the existing
reasonable and balanced economic regulation of their business and we will argue
forcefully against legislation or regulation

                                        <p>that would needlessly complicate rail service
or cap rates. Reregulating the railroads is a
sure-fire way to reduce much needed capital
investment in the national railroad network.
RT&amp;S: How does the NRC attempt
to accomplish its legislative goals on
Capitol Hill?
Baker: As Terry mentioned earlier, the key
to the NRC’s legislative success in D.C. is
the active participation of our membership.</p>
                                    
                                        <p>Congressmen only care what I have to say
because I am representing their constituents. Hearing frequently and forcefully from
those constituents directly is by far the most
effective way to get our messages across.
Also, in addition to our own direct legislative efforts, the NRC is a member of
the OneRail Coalition, with APTA, the
AAR, ASLRRA, Amtrak, NARP, RSI, the
States for Passenger Rail Coalition and
other key rail industry groups. When all</p>

                                        <p>of those groups can agree and go to Congress with a coordinated message, we’re a
powerful force, representing hundreds of
thousands of workers and tens of billions
of dollars of economic activity.
RT&amp;S: Beyond the immediate priorities of tax credits and guarding against
increased truck size and weights and
increased regulation of the freight railroads, what are the NRC’s other legislative and policy priorities?
Baker: We are supportive of the TIGER
grant program. Of the $3.1 billion in funding that has been distributed in TIGERs
1-4, almost $1.6 billion has gone to railrelated projects, including Class 1 projects, shortline system upgrades, port rail
infrastructure projects, commuter rail
extensions, light-rail lines, streetcar projects, transit stations and intermodal hubs.
In 2012, 24 rail-related projects received
more than $297 million out of the $500
million of available funding, which was
great news for the rail construction and
supply industry. A TIGER 5 program was
funded at $474 million in the recently
passed FY13 appropriations bill and that
process will get underway shortly. The
NRC will continue to aggressively back
funding for these types of multi-modal
merit-based discretionary grant programs,
whether in the form of TIGER 6, or potentially a program of Projects of National
and Regional Significance or an Infrastructure Bank in the next surface transportation reauthorization bill.
The NRC is also advocating for
improvements to the Railroad Rehabilita-</p>
                                    
                                        <p>tion &amp; Improvement Financing (RRIF)
loan program by subsidizing the interest
rate and allowing payment deferrals similar to the Transportation Infrastructure
Finance And Innovation Act program.
Other improvements can be made by making the collateral rules more reasonable,
enforcing the intent of the 90-day clock
rules and allowing railroads to use the program for refinancing purposes as provided
by law. RRIF is a $35-billion infrastructure
loan program that is underutilized by the
railroads, but we are seeing a recent pickup in activity, at least on the application
side. RRIF provides low interest (around
3.5 percent currently), 35-year loan money
for railroad rehabilitation and construction. Since 2002, the FRA has approved
33 RRIF loans for a combined total of
approximately $1.7 billion.
The NRC will work with our railroad
customers to protect and expand the Section
130 Grade Crossing Program, which has a
long record of success in improving public
safety, but only funds a small fraction of the
documented needs.
The NRC will work with APTA and
other rail transit advocacy support groups
to make sure that Congress continues the
meaningful rail transit investments of the
past decade. More and more U.S. cities are
realizing the economic and environmental benefits provided by constructing and
expanding light rail and metro systems and
we are seeing a shift in travel patterns across
the country. However, this momentum is
at risk as the funding for the mass transit
account of the highway trust fund is no longer sufficient to expand and maintain the</p>
                                    
                                        <p>system. Simply put, more funding needs to
be dedicated to rail transit investments and
the NRC will work hard in D.C. every day
to get that message across to Congress.
And the NRC will continue work with
passenger rail advocacy groups to aggressively support and fund a meaningful investment into the national intercity passenger
rail network.
RT&amp;S: Any closing thoughts?
Benton: I would like to thank my fellow
board members and all the NRC member
companies for supporting me in my position
as chairman of the board. I am humbled
to represent a great organization in a great
industry. I believe the NRC has the proper
priorities for our membership – leadership
in safety initiatives and training materials,
advocacy in legislative and regulatory matters,
membership growth, a high-quality conference and maintaining a high level of interaction with the other key industry organizations.
We are gaining membership, setting
conference attendance records and getting
unprecedented participation in our “Safe
Contractor of the Year” contest – all signs
pointing toward a healthy and active organization. Our committee members and directors of the board are active and engaged
with a high level of support from their
respective employers. I would like to thank
the NRC member companies that support
those who serve on the board and on the
committees for allowing us to dedicate some
of our time to this quality organization.
The state of the National Railroad Construction and Maintenance Association is
stronger than ever.

focus has been on expanding its infrastructure to enhance technology and
to expand capacity to produce special
trackwork to Class 1 railroad standards.
In the past 12 months, the company has
made significant capital investments as
part of its commitment to maintain its
present customer base, as well as meet
the demand with better delivery times.
Atlantic Track added 25,000
square feet of additional space to
house new machinery, increased the
layout and assembly area, added a
new CNC mill and expanded the
engineering department at its trackwork manufacturing plant in Memphis, Tenn. Additionally, the company
added a gantry-type, CNC mill at its

Ill.; installed a new CNC plate mill
at its plant in St. Clair, Pa., and purchased a mobile flash-butt welder.
“Railroad budgets and spending for
special trackwork material have been at
a high level during the past several years
and, so far, seem to be stable,” explained
Jeff Grissom, director of engineering.
“We expect that as the general economy
continues to improve, demand for railroad products will stay at a high level or
increase as railroads of all sizes expand
their ability to move more freight.”
At Atlantic Track’s St. Clair, Pa.,
facility, the company has installed an
enhanced electric third rail manufacturing, processing and assembly work
center. With the nations renewed interest in passenger rail service, Grissom
says this will better position the company to service that part of the special
trackwork industry, as well as maintaining a domestic-based supply chain
for those components.
Atlantic Track is a joint venture
partner in MRT Track &amp; Services</p>

a manufacturer of special trackwork
and provider of railway materials to
transit systems throughout the world.
This joint venture has developed a
heavy-haul steel crosstie that is based
on an existing German design and is
currently under testing and evaluation
at the TTCI test track in Pueblo, Colo.
“From an engineer’s perspective
of the special trackwork community,
turnout geometry in the area of entry
at point of switch and mainline speeds
through turnouts seem to be at the forefront of discussion,” Grissom noted. “In
addition, as an industry, we are learning and defining the parameters for full
flange-bearing crossings and their correct usage, as it would pertain to crossing angle and signalization.”</p>

“We are actively and aggressively

Jim Remington, vice president of engineering. “We are also focusing on new
designs related to passenger rail, which
is a coordinated effort between engineering and sales.”
Remington says commuter rail
companies are looking for greater

Nortrak-produced pad concrete tie insulators have been standard for Kansas

                                        <p>Progress Rail Services Corp. (PRS)
is a full-line manufacturer of special
trackwork, including turnouts, crossing diamonds and replacement maintenance items for all sizes and designs
for railroad and transit industries.
Turnouts and crossing diamonds
are subjected to high-impact use that
affects the overall life-cycle cost of the
components. Progress Rail Services
says it is continuing to design products that eliminate or minimize these
impacts to reduce maintenance and
increase the overall product life.
“In 2006, we introduced the lift
frog and we now have more than
1,000 units in track and counting,”
said Russ Hein, manager of engineering services for the Engineering and
Track Services Division. “To complement the lift frog, we recently intro-</p>
                                    
                                        <p>duced the vertical switch and, when
combined with the lift frog, makes the
turnout virtually invisible to mainline
traffic. The turnout was installed at
TTCI for industry testing and is now
installed in a Class 1 track.”
The OWLS design eliminates the
flangeway gap on the mainline heavy
run and is said to greatly reduce crossing maintenance. PRS says it has
OWLS castings that will accommodate a wide range of angles to reduce
lead-times. The company is continuing
work on improving its full-flange-bearing design. To date, there have been
three full-flange-bearing crossings
installed on Class 1 railroads.
“Through our continued efforts
to reduce wheel impacts within turnout and crossing components, we are
striving to achieve the railroad industry’s goal of reduced maintenance and
overall lower product life-cycle cost,”
explained Hein. “Providing a quality
product is a given and we continually
work toward developing designs that
will reduce the overall cost of ownership. Further, reducing lead times
and meeting delivery commitments is
important to us too, so as not to impact
our customers’ project schedules.”</p>

                                        <p>Inc. (TTCI), has assisted Association
of American Railroads (AAR) member
railroads in implementing new turnout
features in 2012-2013. These include
the conformal profile switch points
and the continuous mainline rail turnout. Several others are currently in
prototype testing at the Facility for
Accelerated Service Testing (FAST) at
TTC in Pueblo, Colo.
The conformal profile switch point
was developed with the help of BNSF,
Union Pacific (UP), CSX, Progress
Rail Services and voestalpine Nortrak
Inc. The cross-section profile of the
switch point was altered to more closely match the canted rail profile seen
in the rest of the track. This change
in profile has reduced the occurrence
of rolling contact fatigue and reduced
initial wear rates by 50 percent in revenue service prototype testing. Based
on these results, the design is being
adopted as the standard profile for
BNSF, UP and CSX.</p>

                                        <p>The continuous mainline rail turnout was developed by BNSF, Progress
Rail Services and TTCI to address
the currently used split switch failure modes. As the name implies, the
mainline running rails of this turnout are continuous and fixed. Both
switch points are on the diverging
route. TTCI notes that this turnout
has improved performance for the</p>
                                    
                                        <p>mainline route in terms of forces and
ride quality. The intended use of this
design is at set-out tracks and mainline
industrial sidings; where the diverging
traffic is low speed and low tonnage.
“Demand is increasing among
freight railroads and transit systems
for premium performance products,”
said David Davis, senior scientist
at TTCI. “Our approach is to put</p>
                                    
                                        <p>47</p>
                                    
                                        <p/>

                                        <p>the premium performance capabilities where they are
most needed. The continuous mainline rail turnout is a
good example in that the performance of the mainline
route, which will carry 99 percent of the traffic, is greatly
improved. This is essential to operations that carry either
heavy-axle-loads or high-speed service.”
Davis explains that the trend continues to be in
improved dynamic performance and results in improved
safety and efficiency for the railways. Smoothing and/or
eliminating discontinuities will result in better performing
designs, he notes.
“This involves changes large and small, such as the
removal of flangeway gaps and switch points from the
mainline route of the turnout to relatively small changes in
running surface profiles in frogs and switches,” he noted.
Prototypes in test at FAST include an improved steering
switch for mainline crossovers. The switch will help vehicles
steer away from the switch point tip on either route, Davis
says, and should result in lower maximum vehicle forces
and longer switch point life. Another prototype at FAST are
turnout foundations (e.g., pads for the tie-ballast interface)
that will smooth out vertical stiffness in turnouts. This is
expected to reduce required surface and alignment maintenance, as well as lower vehicle forces.</p>

“Our technical staff is collaborating closely with freight
railroads to improve both the functionality and durability
of our synthetic pads and insulators,” said Brian Abbott,
executive vice president engineering. “We continue to see
a healthy demand for special trackwork in both the freight
and transit sectors. All indications are that demand will
remain strong through the current year.”
voestalpine Nortrak’s product portfolio comprises everything from conventional and custom-designed steel work,
austenitic manganese castings, component plating and rodding to concrete crossties and synthetic pads and insulators.
Coupled with its full suite of hytronics switch drive and asset
monitoring equipment, voestalpine Nortrak prides itself in
being a “one stop shop” for all trackwork and related needs.
As for where the money is being spent, Abbott said,“We
are seeing the railways adjust their capital plans in response
to changes in traffic commodity mix. Most notably, developments in the petroleum products sector are driving increased
investment in yards, terminals and transfer facilities.”

of technical services. “They improve
decision making based on a more
holistic measurement and analysis
approach. Included in the analysis are
LIDAR information on surface profiles
(drainage) and high-quality imagery to
map assets such as tie type.”
Balfour Beatty Rail’s new ZRL200
20D high-speed LIDAR scanning system produces surface profiles of the
ballast. This can be compared with
customers’ trackbed templates for both
tangent and curved track to identify
areas of noncompliance. The system
also allows detailed structural clearance measurements to be obtained
during routine surveys.

the speed of data collection and minimize the impact on daily operations.”
Balfour Beatty Rail also develops
customized data acquisition systems
that integrate its GPR with existing
third-party track geometry, GRMS
and VTI systems.
Balfour Beatty Rail and Zetica
have many research and development
initiatives in progress designed to
improve the use of radar technology
within the railroad environment. An
example of this is the deployment
of the next generation of antennas
that will further enhance information
on the trackbed, including material
types and moisture.

type of track maintenance, the ability to
maneuver has always been an important factor, whether it’s the machine
you’re working with or the attachment

engineer at Ballast Tools Equipment
Company (BTE). “Backhoe hi-rail systems are becoming increasingly popular
because customers want the ability to
easily perform on- or off-track tasks
with the same piece of equipment.
“Customers want to get the most
out of what they’ve got,” noted Weyand. “In addition to providing parts
with longer wear life, we’re performing machine upgrades on existing
equipment. BTE provides undercutter
upgrades, installing new high-performance motors that double the cutting
speed, providing more torque in the
cut. This upgrade also includes replacing the gear box and adding a customized Ballast Tools Inc. undercutter bar
with field-replaceable wear strips. Not
only did we make it more powerful, we
reduced the need for maintenance, saving valuable time in the process.”</p>

The Dymax SMS has more than
a year of field work under its belt and
bolts on to the Ballast Blaster like an
attachment, does not require a separate engine to operate and performs
with rugged toughness, says Switzer.
The remaining lineup of Dymax

                                        <p>Georgetown Rail Equipment’s (GREX)
ballast maintenance offerings have
undergone recent modifications to further improve reliability and performance.
“GREX’s Solaris is an electric
over hydraulic kit that converts manually-operated ballast gates into a
safe, remotely controlled operation,”
explained Lynn Turner, vice president
of marketing and sales. “GateSync
builds on Solaris kits by providing automated and seamless ballast unloading
at speeds up to 10 mph, safely eliminating the need for walking personnel and
maximizing short work windows.”
Solaris kits mechanical and electrical hardware upgrades aimed at boosting performance and ruggedness. With
a Solaris kit, one operator can unload a
ballast car’s four or more gates simultaneously using the supplied remote
control. These recent enhancements</p>
                                    
                                        <p>included improved internal hydraulic
components, the associated plumbing
and redesigned electrical boards, all of
which enhance reliability and performance, GREX notes.
“We expect these improvements to
result in longer life, less maintenance
and increased durability,” said Turner.
Recent enhancements to GREX’s
GateSync include the optional incorporation of BallastSaver and software
upgrades for improved accuracy performance. The software upgrades offer
improved car-to-car signal transmissions,
in addition to an enhanced operator
interface that displays real-time information to aid in the unloading process.
“With the incorporation of BallastSaver, GateSync now provides the
most technologically-advanced method
of quantifying and delivering ballast,”
noted Turner. “Traditional ballast
delivery has always been subjective,
leaving too much rock in some areas,
but delivering too little in others. This
new, more sophisticated service, using
LIDAR, takes a 3-D survey of the ballast profile along the track and calculates the exact amount of ballast needed in order to conform to a customer’s
ideal standard profile.”</p>

of material, therefore reducing the
chance of cars becoming off-balance
and eliminating skips. SMART train
technology also gave us the ability to
dump up to 30 cars of ballast per mile
on concrete skeletonized track.”
Both GPS trains use pre-dump surveys to determine the amount of ballast that will be spread. When there is
no GPS available, this process can be
lengthy and allows for a certain amount
of human subjectivity, says HRSI. The
human subjectivity was removed and
the ProScan LIDAR truck now scans
the surface of the track and determines
the appropriate amount of material
needed based on the railroad-provided
template. HRSI notes that the LIDAR
truck increases the speed at which the
survey can be completed and provides
a more robust survey. The ProScan
LIDAR Truck utilizing a P.L.U.S./
SMART Train inertial system allowed
the pre-dump survey to better match
the train’s technology.
“This alone was a huge advancement
in our ballast delivery system technology,” Francis said. “Our accuracy when
dumping is also enhanced with LIDAR
surveys, allowing us to reduce the dump
zones so the trains can deliver ballast
closer to fixed locations.”
GPS outages still have the ability
to negatively impact the trains, notes
Francis. HRSI’s answer was to replace the standard GPS antennas with
P.L.U.S./SMART Train inertial systems similar to what the ProScan LIDAR truck employs.
“After thorough analysis, we have

                                        <p>Knox Kershaw Inc. (KKI) is currently
engineering some enhancements to
the operating components on its ballast regulators to include touch-screen
operation; integrated, programmable
joysticks; hydraulic system diagnostics
and general machine troubleshooting.
These enhancements are expected to
improve operator accuracy, decrease
operator fatigue and reduce down time
in the field due to misdiagnosis of machine issues. Also in the works for next
year, KKI ballast regulators will have
pre-programmed operations.
Due to customer requests, KKI is
working on a new design for its yard
cleaner to improve operational efficiency
and transportability. Also, at the request
of a transit railroad, KKI developed a
brushcutter-only machine (based on
the KSF 940 with brushcutter attachment) which has a blade designed to cut
through dense brush and small trees.</p>
                                    
                                        <p>(TLU). The company has expanded
features of the TLU, which include track
positioning, an improved sledding blade
and a tie-pad replacement module. Loram has also added enhancements to its
ballast cleaners and Railvacs that improve travel efficiencies and safety.
Loram says railroads are aware of
the long-term sustainable benefits
through increased budgets for ballast
maintenance activities. Scott Diercks,
product development manager, says
customers are working to maintain
their ballast section in a preventative
maintenance mode.
“Strategically, this allows our customers to cover more of their system
rather than only focusing on problematic areas,” he noted. “In addition, it
lowers overall costs, increases traffic
throughput and provides more return
on their investment.”
Loram has also seen a trend to coordinate equipment with system work
gangs during major track outages.
Utilizing work blocks in this fashion
allows Loram to provide optimal production and reduce lower overall cost
for the customer.
Currently, Loram is expanding its
fleet of Railvacs for specialty ballast
evacuation in areas of tight clearances,
such as ballast deck bridges, switch
winterization, tunnels and on transit
properties. The company notes that its
Railvac is designed to work on tough
Class 1 railroad conditions, but flexible
enough to accommodate transit and
commuter railroads.</p>

trains delivery system. The inertial system allows for us to maintain our ballast
dumping accuracy for a longer period of
time when the GPS signal is lost.”
HRSI was recently requested to survey a tunnel that was more than two
miles long. It’s R&amp;D and operations
teams were heavily involved in the process and the company says it successfully dumped using the SMART train, on
both shoulders and center of the track,
using its new P.L.U.S./SMART Train
GNSS Inertial System technology.</p>

from anywhere within a ballast train,
eliminating the need for grouping manual and automatic cars.
Miner has been working on ways to
simplify the application of the aggregate systems.
“We are making these changes to
help car builders and car shops streamline the applications and reduce labor
costs,” explained Chris Gaydos, manager mechanical engineering.
Miner has provided twin-cylinder,
remote control-operated ballast systems for cars exported to South America. In addition, Miner provided AggreGates to FreightCar America Inc. for a
162-car BNSF build and continues to
supply various models for car conversions and ballast car upgrades. Miner
AggreGate is available in pry bar manual, push-button or remote-control
operations using pneumatic or electric
power to operate the gates.</p>

                                        <p>ditional 54 Bi-Directional Ballast Plows
will be added to new ballast car builds
for BNSF, for a total of 169 units in service since the plow’s inception.
“We are very pleased to produce
our innovative ballast plow for the railroads,” stated Della Ehlke, owner of
Montana Hydraulics. “We expect more
railroad MOW programs will consider
our ballast plow in the near future.”
Ehlke also notes that the yearly contract to provide ballast delivery field
services for a Class 1 railroad continues to grow, as it has since 1998. Up
to 16 field operating personnel manage
the placement of ballast and riprap, as
well as provide maintenance and repair
for the specialty MOW units throughout the BNSF system.
Montana Hydraulics currently
manages more than 1,600 MOW cars
for its customers. The company expects to branch out to additional Class
1s in 2014.</p>
                                    
                                        <p>NMC Railway Systems</p>
                                    
                                        <p>A new introduction into the NMC
Railway Systems’ ballast maintenance
product line is the spoil system offered</p>
                                    
                                        <p>on the 10-ft., 12-ft. and 15-ft. undercutter bars. The bi-directional chain
with fixed teeth on the spoil system allows for quick touch ups after cutting
and eliminates bit replacement. The
undercutter bar spoil system allows
operators the ability to cut in tight locations with up to 360-degree rotation.
This allows for increased maneuverability and productivity while undercutting and lessens the amount of time
spent removing ballast in one area.
NMC Railway Systems says hi-rail
machines allow ease and accessibility to remote track locations and with
that, are receiving more requests for
this machine type. The 312 or 324 HiRail Excavators allows railroads the
advantage of tracking on hi-rail up to
40 miles to remote locations in order
to manage ballast projects. In addition, operators can move on- and offrail without a dedicated crossing or an
added machine, which helps to maximize time and increase productivity.
“For smaller projects, we have received inquiries on our 420F IT backhoe with a 6-ft. undercutter bar and
360-degree bi-directional chain,” explained Chuck Haskell, sales manager.
“This machine is best for quick spot
cutting on small sections of track and
around track crossings for drainage issues. Our team is continually looking
at ways to improve the productivity of
railroad gangs on ballast maintenance
projects. The increased demand for hirail machines has kept us busy and we
are improving our product line to meet
those demands.”</p>

                                        <p>Nordco Inc. is deepening its ballastrelated product line with the addition
of two new cribbers. The first, a selfpropelled, single-operator machine
with track travel speeds up to 25 mph,
which includes a dual monitor system
for viewing of tie positioning and ballast plowing operations. This cribber
also includes integrated rail clamps,
ballast plows, cribber workheads and
tie pushers.
“The two monitors allow the operator to see the work area clearly,” noted
Dana Michaels, marketing manager.
“One monitor shows the tie area, allowing precise positioning of the tie
with the tie pushers. The other monitor,
which has a split screen format, shows
the left and right ballast wings, allowing
precise shaping of the ballast area.”

use of an existing crane by adding cribbing capabilities. After an adapter kit
is installed, the crane then powers and
controls the cribbing functions on this
portable option.
“Nordco has also been steadily
deepening its replacement parts services, in particular, developing replacement parts for tampers,” explained
Michaels. “We now offer almost a complete line of replacement parts for the
Jackson 6700 models, as well as the entire Mark I-IV tamper series. In many
cases, we have identified components
that fail due to flaws in their original
design and we have used that information to develop stronger, more reliable
replacement components.”
Nordco says railroads are consistently asking for tools that keep their
employees safer, while simultaneously
increasing productivity. Therefore, Nordco has been fitting more of its equipment with fully-enclosed, extended cabs
that protect multiple crew members
during work and travel modes.</p>
                                    
                                        <p>Plasser American</p>
                                    
                                        <p>Regular ballast cleaning is one of the
mainstays for low maintenance cost
of tracks and turnouts and a long service life of the track material, explains
Plasser American Corp.
“Basically, the working principle of
a ballast cleaning machine is always the
same: The ballast material is excavated,
the material is screened to separate ballast from spoil, the cleaned ballast is returned to the track and the spoil is taken away,” said the company. “However,
there is a wide spectrum of operating
conditions which influence the choice
of the machine best suited for the job.
This includes the size of the track network, working with long-term track
possessions or short intervals between
trains, cleaning in tracks, cleaning plain
track, cleaning turnouts and on-track
cleaning or cleaning where the tracks
or the turnouts have been removed.”
Plasser’s new machine, the URM
700, performs continuous-action, railmounted ballast bed cleaning on plain
track, as well as continuous-action ballast bed cleaning in turnouts, which
has been achieved through development and construction. The system
also incorporates a screening car and
material conveyor and hopper units.
“The core component of the URM
700 is its excavating unit in the form
of a sword with a horizontally-rotating
RT&amp;S Track Buyer’s Guide</p>
                                    
                                        <p>2014	</p>
                                    
                                        <p>excavating chain,” the company said.
“The excavating width of the sword can
be varied infinitely and without manual
operation up to a width of 20 feet. There
is no preparation work required to dig
an entry hole for the guide bar.”
It can be used on either side of the
machine and is supported on the other
end when slewed inwards. The excavating unit works without support only in
short transition areas.
The excavating depth is variable and
the formation slope can be adjusted.
Special lifting clamps hold the turnout
in position until it is filled with ballast
from the slewing conveyor belts. Shoulder excavating units first clear the area
at the tie ends. After the return run, the
sword is slewed in and the ballast bed
material is sent to the shoulder excavating unit. If necessary, new ballast can be
added to the cleaned ballast. Complete
exchange of ballast is also possible.
“The URM 700 is a good example
of the innovative spirit in our company,” noted Plasser. “New machine
models are tested thoroughly under
actual worksite conditions before they
are handed over to our customers. Due
to the fast and independent installation
and removal of the excavating guide
bar, the URM 700 can also work costeffectively on short sections of track
(spot cleaning).”</p>

Services Corp. has recently launched
its new Model 4600 Ballast Regulator.
This machine addresses many issues
that have been discussed with customers during product meetings. The machine is designed utilizing a cab forward
design, offering enhanced visibility and
improved operator ergonomics. It addresses issues regarding component</p>
                                    
                                        <p>location and accessibility, making all
components easily accessible for maintenance purposes.
Progress Rail Services is also active in offering new designs of ballast
regulators for the international market,
including high-powered machines with
hoppers for transferring ballast, sand
fighting machines and single-pass ballast regulating machines. Ballast cleaning and ballast reclamation is another
area where Kershaw has been actively
working with customers. Kershaw recently delivered a new KSC2000 High
Speed Shoulder Cleaner that is capable of cleaning the shoulder ballast,
screening and spoiling the waste and
returning the cleaned ballast back onto
the shoulder.
“Our equipment leasing subsidiary,
Progress Rail Equipment Leasing,
also has a full fleet of ballast maintenance equipment that is available for
short-term rental or long-term leases,” noted Randy Chubaty, national
sales manager. “Progress Rail Equipment Leasing offers customized leases
based on each customers need and
each lease can be structured to satisfy
any requirement.”</p>

currently building a larger hi-rail excavator with a bigger undercutting bar. The
larger machine will have more hydraulic power to perform more efficiently in
hard conditions and the longer bar will
be beneficial for switch undercutting.
Dennis Hanke, sales manager, says
the company has received requests for
greater versatility for switch undercutting, which has resulted in RCE developing this larger machine.</p>

ELM is also working on a new biobased top-of-rail (TOR) friction modifier, which is oil based but includes
biobased and natural drying fluids for
better friction management and performance at cold temperatures.
“It appears that the railroads will be
spending much more on friction reduction through lubrication because it
makes economic sense,” Lou Honary,
chairman and president, noted. “Friction reduction improves fuel economy
and as the cost of fuel goes up, the cost
of lubrication can easily be justified.
Increase longevity of rolling stock and
reduction in noise and other benefits will
be welcome adders.”
ELM is participating in a department of transportation-funded field
test project that is currently on-going
at the University of Northern Iowa’s</p>
                                    
                                        <p>National Ag-Based Lubricants Center.
That project is conducting a comparative evaluation of conventional and soybean oil-based rail curve greases in the
laboratory and in the field. The results
of that study are expected to provide
insight into the performance attributes
of biobased rail curve greases.
ELM biobased rail curve greases are
sold through distributors, including the
Illinois-based Plews &amp; Edelmann under
the brand name UltraLube.</p>

                                        <p>L.B. Foster Rail Technologies says the
choice of material used to control friction at the TOR/wheel tread interface
is critical.
According to Brian Vidler, vice president friction management trackside
applications, “Our KELTRACK® family of products remain the industry’s
only true friction modifiers, providing
the guaranteed intermediate friction
levels and positive friction characteristics that can reduce wear, forces,
energy, noise and corrugations withRT&amp;S Track Buyer’s Guide</p>

In addition, the dry, thin film technology used in the KELTRACK family of
products acts to mitigate the initiation
and growth of rolling contact fatigue,
whereas liquid materials can actually
accelerate the growth of rolling contact
fatigue, leading to significant rail surface issues.”
Through chemistry advancement of
KELTRACK, has come the adoption
of KELTRACK ER (Enhanced Retentivity) in heavy-haul freight. The company notes there has been an intense
effort to monitor and verify the impacts
of adopting the improved chemistry in
revenue service conditions.
“We have been delighted to see
data emerge during the past two years
that is proving out the reductions in
material usage that are possible with
this technology, leading to significant
savings for the customer-base and an
even stronger financial return on KELTRACK projects,” Vidler noted. “In
addition, we are hard at work proving out the improvements that KELTRACK ER can offer in material carry
distance, which could lead to wider
spacing between wayside units without
compromising the proven benefits of
TOR friction control.”
As the “dig ital railway” takes
shape, L.B. Foster has been improving its Remote Performance Monitoring (RPM) system for data collection
and transmission from its application
systems. The company is incorporating access to a wider range of sensor and data types, including curving force, rail stress and temperature
measurements, that will allow the
RPM framework to maximize wheel/
rail system performance.
Steve Fletcher, vice president friction management mobile applications,
said, “As with the PROTECTOR wayside platform, our product design and
development teams are working aggressively to advance this product platform
and make it even easier to implement
and install on a range of vehicle types.
The use of RPM systems allows for a
highly-flexible fleet of systems that can
be integrated into ‘smart’ management
and maintenance strategies through
intelligent use of data.”</p>

nearly 300 TOR units. Loram developed a new application bar and pumping system for its TOR friction management systems, which the company has
delivered to several locations.
“These enhancements to the system
allow the application rate to be adjusted to an extremely fine resolution,”
explained Jon Behrens, general manager, friction management services at
Loram. “One of the key advantages of
the new application bar and pumping
system is being able to distribute friction modifier in even colder temperatures, which allows for a more consistent use and benefit of the friction
management system. These systems
have been working in the Powder River
area with no issues on delivery of the
friction modifier to the rail.”
As railroads continue to learn about
rail life and track component benefits
that TOR and gauge-face lubricators
deliver, Loram has seen an increase in
the demand for TOR lubrication systems and friction modifier.
“This demand will continue to
increase during the next few years,”
explained Behrens. “The railroads
continue to review their lubrication
programs and are making decisions on
what approach will work best for them.
In addition, railroads continue to evaluate the amount of lubrication and the
appropriate number of units they need
to drive the best benefit.”</p>

                                        <p>Midwest Industrial Supply, Inc., has
been testing different variations of its
Glidex® synthetic switch lubricant. The
added proprietary conditioner for initial
testing has shown an improvement in
reducing friction on metal surfaces. The
company is analyzing the overall cost
versus benefit factor for its customers
to determine if this would be an offering that would positively impact them
in terms of performance and longevity.
“In terms of lubrication for switches,” said Eric Vantiegham, rail and
transit sales, “I believe there are four
main factors that our customers are
looking for: performance, environmental impact, ease of application and
value. Glidex covers all the bases in
these regards. However, with most businesses today, the railroads are doing
more work with fewer resources, so it is
important to continue to strive for bet-</p>

lubricant performance.”
Midwest Industrial recently sold
a prototype powered applicator for
applying Glidex to switches in a large
hump yard for a Class 1 railroad. The
goal is to reduce the amount of time
and effort it takes to perform the task
of lubricating the switch. This system
is expected to treat more than 400
switches from one tank with a comfortable pistol grip-type applicator and
is powered by 12 volt DC, so it can be
placed in any pickup truck bed and be
powered using the truck’s battery.</p>

                                        <p>ration,” explained Bob Pieper, president. “Because of the minimal amount
of grease used, there is optimal grease
displacement and complete consumption of the lubricant, reduction or
elimination of hazardous mats and virtually no waste of product, while still
achieving a tremendous cost savings in
wasted or unused lubricant.”
Since there is no contact with the
train, there is less maintenance. The
unit can be mounted at the apex of
the cur ve where lubricant is carried down the rail from bi-directional traffic and there is virtually
no cast off from centrifugal forces
of the wheels, which causes fouling
of ballast and creates environmental issues. It is designed for quick
removal and re-installation for track
maintenance and servicing.
“RBL hopes that we begin to see
orders for the New Linear Wayside
Lubrication System in mid to late
2013, after the final design is completed and further field testing confirms
the tremendous advantages of this new
technology for this application system,” Pieper noted.</p>

Wise, director of railroad sales. “Our
new lubricator has many features that
the market has needed for many years.
In addition, Whitmore Rail continues
to develop new TOR friction modifiers
that address the performance concerns
in the North American freight market.”
Wise says the rail industry today is
much more diversified in its mix of traffic and the focus on technology and efficiency has intensified. As the economy
grows and goods in the U.S. become
more global, he notes, the demand for
cost-efficient transport will increase.
“This fits the rail business model
perfectly,” Wise explained. “We believe
the overall freight-rail spend will meet
or slightly exceed [previous] levels, with
a close eye on the world economy.”
The next year, in general, looks like
it will be a growth year for overall rail

ARRT Inc. is an internationally-recognized safety-driven railway engineering
consultancy firm. Our team of industry
experts, specialists and associates provide practical solutions through investigative research and analysis to the most
difficult railway engineering problems.
ARRT also develops standards and policies for better track maintenance using
the most modern methodologies available
to ensure optimal track /train interaction
and component life. As a key developer
of innovative track technology, ARRT
combines analytical tools available in
Computer-Aided Design,
Finite Element Analysis, and event
simulation with data from laboratory
and field-testing to design better track
components. ARRT’s experiences from
derailment investigations and failure
analysis has led to the development of
our track/train interaction software called
ASET. ASET considers parameters such
as multiple vehicle wheels, articulation
of the train, train action, power location/distribution in the train, track curvature, grade and thermal effects. Proper
track/power asset management cannot be
achieved without track/train interaction
that respects these parameters.</p>

Etienne Floriot, Sales Manager
Atlantic and Pacific Rail Supply manufacture Cedar Tie Plugs meeting Class 1
specifications since 1939. According to
certain information, softwood tie plugs
hold the spike better than hardwood tie
plugs. Cedar (soft wood) tie plugs do
not have to be treated because they will
absorb the treatment that the ties received.
Density of Cedar is lighter than hardwood, thus, when the Cedar Tie Plugs are
driven in spike holes, it does not damage
the ties. We deliver across North America
and Mexico. RTA Member.

Holland is a manufacturer and contractor for electric flash butt welding equipment and services. In-track welding, using
either a hi-rail truck or Porta Plant, is performed by our crews doing crop and weld,
closure or repair welding. New construction, steel gangs and relay operations are
just some examples of the applications for
flash butt welding.
TrackSTAR® track testing services,
including track strength, track geometry and
rail profile is another contracting service
provided by Holland. Our fleet of hi-rail
trucks mark exceptions and give you daily
strip charts and exception reports. Tie summary and statistic reports give you data for
maintenance planning.
Holland’s fixed plants weld new and
relay rail for Class 1 railroads, shortlines,
transit systems and contractors. These plants
are located throughout the U.S.A. Whether
using your own rail train or one of Holland’s, we can deliver the rail directly to
your job site. Many of these plants assemble
turnouts as well.
New equipment is designed and built
to our, or your, exacting specifications. If
you need a Mobilewelder®, fixed welding plant (rail train racks, pushers, presses, loading and unloading cars), TrackSTAR® testing vehicles or customized
equipment, contact Holland.
We also supply components for rail
cars, including products to protect the
cargo. This includes locks to hold containers to the railcar and securement systems for steel or paper rolls. Chain tiedown systems hold concrete ties while
in transit.
In addition we provide rail car services including rail car cleaning, car
re­p air, locomotive servicing and trans­
loading operations.

Industrial Metrics’ Rangecam software programs provide comprehensive reporting of
track geometry, GRMS, rail wear, rail profile, rail and wheel wear analysis, tie planning and budgeting, rail replacement planning,
rail grinding and QA, and wheel/rail interface
investigations. Data are graphically represented
on GPS-derived route maps that can be overlaid on satellite, terrain and street-view maps.
Track condition, exception and other reports
are generated by menu-driven search tools that
can be customized for each user. A Track Analyst Enterprise System, which connects to an
Oracle or MS SQL Server database, allows
railways to combine and store all of their track
test data in a single database. Rangecam’s
comprehensive suite of analysis tools enables
Enterprise users to analyze and report on wear
conditions, and plan systemwide maintenance
programs to extend rail and tie life. Rangecam
programs’ ability to accommodate track geometry, GRMS, rail and wheel profile and defect
data from various sources makes Rangecam
an effective tool for all reporting, analysis and
maintenance planning needs.

NARSTCO is a leading manufacturer
of steel crossties and steel tie turnouts.
Advantages and benefits of NARSTCO
Steel Track and Turnout Tie Sets: Costeffective (simple and efficient to assemble and install; turnout assembly savings
3 to 1 versus wood; reduces the ballast
required by as much as 40 percent compared to wood ties; extends life of other
components, such as frogs, points, etc.;
extends life of adjacent wood ties when
interspersed); Track Environment (100
percent recyclable; no deterioration in
fueling facilities; not prone to insect or
bacterial attack; proven derailment survivability and can be repaired in track; no
plate cutting or spike kill); Design Qualities (maintains track gauge and cant angle
and are often used instead of gauge rods;
excellent track stability and lateral load
resistance with a track modulus similar
to hardwood ties; ideal for tunnels and
ballast deck bridges due to low profile
and reduced dead load; can be encased
in concrete or covered in asphalt; easy to
insulate for track circuitry).

Tensar International Corporation has extensive worldwide experience using Biaxial
(BX) Geogrids to reinforce trackbed layers.
When applied for “direct ballast reinforcement” Tensar®, BX Geogrids reduce the rate
of track settlement, resulting in less maintenance over time. When utilized for “granular
sub-ballast reinforcement” they increase the
bearing capacity of the track foundation.

The BODAN® Highway-Rail Grade Crossing System was designed for single, double,
curved track, turnouts and switches requiring heavy-duty surfaces for excessive traffic
loads. Reinforced precast polymer concrete
panels transfer heavy traffic loads directly to
the rails. This unique “bridge” design eliminates direct loading on the ties and maintains
a constant level with the rail throughout the
life of the crossing. The modular panels are
maintenance-free, impervious to salt spray
and have a lifetime skid-resistant surface.
BODAN is the only grade-crossing system
with optional built-in flashing warning lights.
